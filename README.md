# Aviation Accidents Visualization Project
----
Air travel stands as an undeniable revolution in the transportation sector, delivering a multitude of invaluable advantages. These include unprecedented speed, unparalleled global connectivity, and a continuous drive for innovation. Nevertheless, the aviation industry encounters its fair share of challenges and predicaments, especially concerning the issue of safety. In the pages that follow, we delve into the intricate tapestry of aviation safety, exploring how it varies among different countries, aircraft types, and operators. This project involves a comprehensive analysis of plane crash data collected over 50 years from 1973 to 2023. We employed D3, JSON, JS, Plotly, and JQuery. We aimed to create an informative representation of historical plane crash data which could allow stakeholders to uncover patterns, trends, and insight.

Questions to be considered:
Can we accurately predict where plane crashes are likely to occur?
Are there certain airlines that have more crashes than others?
Are there possible outside factors affecting these trends?

To find the answer to our many questions, we obtained the requisite information by means of a customized Extract-Transform-Load process. Once the data was available, we created a suite of interactive toolkits.

On a positive note, our analysis demonstarted reduced mortality from aviation accidents over the last fifty years. We summarized our findings in a series of visual aids.

Although we could not accurately predict the locations of plane crashes only the likelihood based on past events, we did observe some trends.  During the last ten years, China Eastern Airlines has experienced the largest fatalities. Although the reasons for and concentrations of aviation accidents varied from decade to decade, currently, possible outside factors include terrorism, poor maintenance, and employee malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance. But, one thing for certain, the next flight on China Eastern Airlines' domestic passenger flight from Kunming Changshui International Airport to Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport on a Boeing 737 should likely be avoided!
