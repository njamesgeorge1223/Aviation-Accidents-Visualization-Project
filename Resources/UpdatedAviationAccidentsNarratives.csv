1029,ACC1003,"China General Aviation Corp. flight 7552, a Yakovlev Yak-42D, was destroyed when it crashed during takeoff from Nanjing Dajiaochang Airport in China. Of the 126 persons on board the flight, 19 survived the accident.The aircraft operated on a scheduled passenger service to Xiamen Airport. During an attempted takeoff from runway 06, the flight failed to rotate, even as the speed increased past Vr speed.The flight crew then attempted to abort the takeoff, but the aircraft overran the runway at high speed. After 420 meters the aircraft crossed a 22 feet wide drainage ditch and impacted a 2 metre high embankment. The aircraft's ground speed at the time was 210 km/h (113 kts). It broke up and caught fire.It was established that the aircraft's horizontal stabiliser was trimmed in the landing configuration. This was not discovered because the crew probably did not perform the pre-flight checklist."
1030,ACC1004,"The Tu-134 operated on a passenger flight from Donetsk to Ivanovo. Weather at the destination was poor with a visibility of 1200 m, haze, drizzle, and an overcast at 110 m.The aircraft deviated from the approach procedures and at a distance of 8600 m from the runway the aircraft was at 500 m (instead of 400 m as prescribed) with a lateral deviation of 1900 m to the right at a speed of 390 km/h with flaps and stabilizer not yet configured for final approach. None of the crew members reported the altitude and speed to the commander and the navigator had not given any information to allow the aircraft to align with the runway and glide path. The navigator then suggested the captain to select flaps to 20° and to make a turn to align with the runway. The captain ignored this and continued his approach with performing the necessary actions. While descending through a height of 350 m the GPWS sounded. The flight crew did not react to this warning.At a distance of 4500 m from the runway, the aircraft had a 200300 m lateral deviation from the approach path and had reached a height of 200 m. To reach the landing course, the commander began to turn to the right with a roll of up to 35°. The turn was performed uncoordinated, with the result that the vertical speed increased to 15-16 m/s. The approach continued to be unstabilized and at an altitude of about 80 m the navigator made a last attempt to convince the aircraft commander of the need for a go-around. Two seconds later the captain likely saw trees ahead and attempted a manouvre to avoid a collision.The aircraft struck trees 2962 m from the runway at a speed of 370 km/h and a rate of descent of 6 m/s. At that moment, the plane was 60 meters to the left of the extended runway centreline. The right wing broke up and the aircraft impacted the ground 512 m after the first point of impact.On the ground, a two storey residential house and several non-residential buildings were damaged."
1031,ACC1005,"The aircraft had just taken off on an experimental flight when it entered a gradually steepening climb. During the climb the aircraft rolled slowly to the right and, at approximately 200 feet above ground level (agl), it entered a steep nose-down, right-wing-low attitude and crashed. Upon impact, the on-board fuel ignited and the majority of the aircraft wreckage was destroyed by fire. The three crew members aboard the aircraft were fatally injured.The Caribou was the initial aircraft of a modification project by NewCal Aviation that involved the removal of the original Pratt & Whitney R-2000-7M2 piston engines and the installation of Pratt & Whitney PT6A-67R turbo-prop engines and associated equipment. The first flight tests of the modified aircraft began on 16 November 1991. The occurrence flight was intended to be the first of several trips designed to flight-check the fuel and hydraulic systems."
1032,ACC1006,"The float-equipped Twin Otter crashed into the jungle 35 yards from the Algodon River when attempting an emergency landing after power loss of the engines. The aircraft had departed Iquitos at 11:25 hours on a flight to El Estrecho, a village on the border with Colombia.The airplane carried the dual military serial FAP304."
1036,ACC1010,The aircraft touched down short of runway 25 at Bellavista Airport (BLP). The right-hand wing and engine broke off and a fire erupted as the aircraft slewed to a stop. The aircraft burned out and all but one of the occupants evacuated alive.
1039,ACC1013,"Douglas DC-7B airtanker N848D had been operating from Stockton, CA (SCK) and had made several drops of retardant on the southeast edge of a fire on the El Dorado National Forest.Their first mission on October 1, 1992, had begun at 08:33. Their fourth mission had them departing the base at 11:56. Their departure was immediately followed by a Lockheed SP2H enroute to the same fire. The DC-7B arrived in the fire vicinity at an elevation of about 6,500 feet MSL at 12:20. Air attack briefed the DC-7Bs two-person flight crew for their retardant drop. Air attack was flying at approximately 7,500 feet MSL. The planned drop was to be made from north to south about one mile west of the upper dam on the reservoir. It was to be the airtankers first drop in this particular location. The visibility was good, in excess of ten miles, and turbulence was reported as mild, but bumpy. The area over the lake to the east of the drop pattern was experiencing reduced visibility due to smoke.According to occupants of the second airtanker, the DC-7B made a turn around the fire and was descending northbound for a drop out of a right hand pattern when the DC-7B captain indicated that he wanted to depart the pattern as he had a problem with an engine. He suggested the second airtanker perform the intended drop while he worked with his engine problem. The second airtanker then received attention from air attack and began a circle to fly a pattern similar to the pattern the DC-7B had flown.Shortly thereafter, air attack asked the DC-7B if he needed to abort (drop) his load of retardant. That captain replied that he might have to if he couldnt solve his engine problem. All communications were normal. Air attack was operating without leadplane assistance as the leadplane had departed the scene for fuel a few minutes before, instructing air attack to perform drops on the west side of the reservoir. Another leadplane was about six minutes out.The mishap airtanker was reported to be descending at about 6,000 feet MSL heading in a north-northwesterly direction after departing the drop pattern, with no visible signs of engine problems and no indication of concern present in his radio transmissions. The DC-7B continued northbound toward gently rising terrain about two miles from the intended drop site and was next observed heading in an easterly direction and low to the ground. The airtanker was reported to be in a sharply pitched up attitude prior to dropping its retardant. Air attack reported that he observed the retardant start and stop, but did not know if a full load had been dropped. He said the load was continuous. The DC-7B was then reported to fall off on the right wing as it descended steeply toward the ground. During this sequence, the captain transmitted on the radio, ""Were going in, were going in.""It was at this point that tree strikes occurred which removed the horizontal stabilizers and elevators from the tail of the airtanker. This entire sequence took place within the span of about 60 seconds. The airtanker then went behind a ridge and white smoke was observed rising from the site. The airtanker had impacted the ground in steep terrain at an elevation of approximately 5,100 feet MSL. Some of the wreckage was deposited in a creek bottom and the remainder was located on an adjacent south-facing slope. Both the captain and copilot were fatally injured. The aircraft was totally destroyed."
1041,ACC1015,The pilot of the Islander lost control in a tight turn after takeoff. The engine probably failed and the aircraft was operated at a weight over the MTOW.
1042,ACC1016,"A Volpar Turboliner II, a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft C-45 Expeditor, crashed during the approach to Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Maryland. The pilot was killed.The airplane operated on a cargo flight from Dayton, Ohio. Prior to departure, the pilot supervised the loading of the airplane. The plane was loaded to a gross weight of 11,979 lb with the cg 2.7 inches behind the aft limit. At the destination, the flight was vectored for an ILS runway 10 approach. About 3 miles from the runway, the pilot was told to make a missed approach due to inadequate separation from traffic. The pilot acknowledged, but soon thereafter, radar contact with the plane was lost. Witnesses saw the plane descend from a low cloud layer before it crashed. There was evidence the plane impacted in a flat attitude with little forward movement. Four cargo straps were found loose with no sign of tensile overload; 3 others and a restraining board were found loose as if they had not been used. No preimpact mechanical problem was found."
1043,ACC1017,"The Fokker F-27 Friendship struck a high ground while on preparing for an approach to runway 36 at Goma Airport. The flight crew descended prematurely and impacted terrain at 8800 feet near the Nkubi intersection, at a point where the approach procedure demanded a passage at FL150."
1045,ACC1019,"The aircraft departed Southend at 06:59 UTC, about one hour before sunrise, on a Special VFR clearance. The aircraft flew to Wallasey via Daventry, White gate and the Liverpool Special Rules Zone at 2,400 feet. It could not be determined why the commander chose to fly this route however, some two weeks before the accident he had spent a short holiday at Haverigg which is close to the direct track from Wallasey to Glasgow.On leaving Wallasey, the aircraft tracked north towards Glasgow and, at 08:01 hrs, the crew called Warton aerodrome stating that they were descending to 1,000 feet and requesting a 'Radar Service'.At 08:10 hrs, an aircraft that had just taken off from Blackpool reported a cloud base of between 2,500 and 3,000 feet and a visibility greater than 20 km. At this time the radar transponder on the aircraft was operating but the height encoding facility had not been selected. Recordings of the Great Dunn Fell and the St Anne's ATC radar heads indicated that the aircraft had left Wallasey on a track of 007°M which was maintained until radar contact was lost at 08:13 hrs at a position one mile to the south west of Walney Island airfield near Barrow in Furness. Consideration of the obscuration due to terrain between the radar heads and the aircraft indicated that, at the time of loss of radar contact, the aircraft would have been no higher than 350 feet amsl and possibly lower.At 08:09 hrs, the time of local sunrise, the crew had called Walney Island stating that they were nine miles south of the airfield at 1,000 feet and requesting overflight of the airfield. At 08:12 hrs, the controller at Walney Island sighted the aircraft abeam the airfield at an estimated height of 800 feet and asked the crew to report at Millom which is about eight miles north of Walney Island. At about the same time, a witness on the beach near the airfield saw the aircraft heading north in and out of cloud at a height estimated to be not above 400 feet. The aircraft did not make the requested position report at Millom and, at 08:16 hrs, the controller advised the crew to call London Information for further service. There was no reply to this call. The last person to see the aircraft reported that it was flying steadily north towards Ponsonby Fell and that the cloud in the area of the Fell was covering the ground at 500 feet above sea level. At about 08:15 hrs a farmer, who was some 600 metres from the crash site, heard a bang from the direction of Ponsonby Fell. He stated that at the time that he heard the bang the weather was very bad with a strong wind, rain and mist covering the fell.The aircraft had flown into ground about 15 metres below the top of Ponsonby Fell."
128,ACC102,Crashed into a mountain.
1046,ACC1020,Bank angle increased to 90deg while climbing through 800 feet in a left turn. The nose pitched down and the aircraft descended rapidly.
129,ACC103,Collided with a snow-covered rocky mountain slope 40 km north-east of Batagay Airport at an altitude of 1020 meters (the height of the mountain 1081 meters). The crew had initiated their descent prematurely.
1057,ACC1031,At FL160 the no. 1 engine was hit by a SAM missile. A forced landing had to be carried out in a field near Luena. One crewmember was killed after stepping on a mine.The actual registration carried at the time of the accident is unknown. CCCP-11121 was cancelled from the Russian register in February 1993.
1058,ACC1032,"A Douglas DC-6 hit the water off Cancún Airport, Mexico, during a test flight. One pilot and two passengers died in the accident. The aircraft departed Cancún Airport at 09:22 hours on a test flight to Cozumel, without the intention to land there, and back to Cancún. The intention was to verify the operation of the engines. In the flight plan the pilot noted that would fly at 2000 feet. At 15 miles from Cozumel, the flight requested authorization from the control tower of Cancún to descend. This was approved.The aircraft descended in unfavorable weather conditions (rain) until it hit the water. The pilot in command and a passenger suffered serious injuries. The co-pilot was fatally injured and the other two passengers were reported missing."
1059,ACC1033,"The DHC-3 Otter was being test-flown after re-assembly. After lifting off the runway it veered left, reaching a height of 75 feet. The left wing contacted the ground and the airplane crashed."
1060,ACC1034,"Following left engine failure at or near V2, the aircraft rolled to the left and contacted the ground beside the runway. The aircraft levelled off on the ground, took off again and rolled left into inverted position before impact."
130,ACC104,The An-2 operated on a positioning flight from Chelyabinsk to Magnitogorsk. The flight crew lost spatial orientation when entering an area with heavy snowfall and poor visibility. The aircraft stalled and crashed in a snow-covered field near Tokmass.
1070,ACC1044,"The aircraft landed on a soccer field due to shortage of fuel, as a result of avoiding a series of severe weather. During the landing run, the aircraft hit an earth mound. The nosewheel broke off and the aircraft nosed over."
1073,ACC1047,The pilot reported he could not move the flight controls after a water drop. The airplane crashed.
1074,ACC1048,"A sudden pitch up when extending flaps from 18deg to 42deg (after passing the Inner Marker at 60 m and 196 km/h IAS) caused the crew to attempt a go-around. The nose continued to pitch up, reaching 40deg nose up. The Let then stalled and crashed 273 m short of the runway. The aircraft had taken off at 850 kg above its MTOW and was some 550 kg above the maximum landing weight. Some 400 kg of luggage had been loaded in the rear, resulting in a centre of gravity beyond the aft limit."
1075,ACC1049,"A Yakovlev 40 passenger jet was destroyed when it crashed on takeoff from Khorog Airport, Tajikistan. All five crew members and 77 of the 81 passengers were killed.The Yakovlev 40, configured to carry 28 passengers, was chartered to fly woman, children and militants to Dushanbe during the Tajikistani Civil War. The crew were forced into accepting more passengers, causing the plane to be grossly overloaded. The aircraft overran the runway at high speed. The left main gear struck a low earth embankment, 150 m beyond the runway end. The right gear struck a concrete pill-box 60 m further. The aircraft then fell into the River Pyanj.The maximum takeoff weight was exceeded by 3,000 kg."
131,ACC105,"An Ilyushin 18V passenger plane was destroyed when it flew into the side of a mountain 32 km northeast of Samarkand Airport (SKD). Seven crew members and 85 passengers were killed, one crew member and 13 passengers survived the accident.The airplane departed Tashkent Airport (TAS) at 14:11 Moscow Time on a domestic service to Samarkand (SKD). Cruising altitude was 5100 metres.At 15:33 the flight was cleared to descend to 2700 m and later further down to 2400 m. At 15:40 the controller reported that the flight was 31 km from Samarkand and cleared the crew to descend to 600 m. The crew did not verify if this distance was correct and continued the descent through clouds. At 15:42 the airplane collided with a snowy mountain slope at a height of 1500 m. The airplane broke in five parts."
1079,ACC1053,"Cessna 208 Caravan VT-AAN, a float equipped plane, was engaged in a round trip from Port Blair with intermediate stops at Dugong Creek and Hut Bay. The aircraft took-off from Hut Bay for Port Blair where it was intended to land on sea adjacent to Viper Island. Soon after touchdown, the aircraft flipped over its nose and sank. Three persons including the pilot evacuated the aircraft. However, one person died due to drowning, as he remained strapped in his seat."
1081,ACC1055,"The Beech Super King Air 300/F, owned by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and operated by the Atlantic City (ACY), New Jersey, Flight Inspection Area Office (FIAO), was destroyed when it crashed into mountainous terrain near Front Royal, Virginia. The three flight crewmembers aboard received fatal injuries.The airplane had departed the nearby Winchester Regional Airport in visual meteorological conditions (VMC) on a routine point-to-point flight to Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport (PHF), Virginia after conducting a flight inspection of the ILS at Winchester Regional Airport. Witnesses described low clouds that were consistent with instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) in the area of the accident site, which was about 15 miles south of the departure airfield. An instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan to PHF was on file in the air traffic control (ATC) system, but the flight plan had not yet been activated.The airplane was flying at 2,000 feet until it struck the high terrain near the Linden VOR, while the pilot in command was awaiting an IFR clearance."
1083,ACC1057,"The aircraft took off from Winnipeg at 1438 CST for a flight to Sandy Lake, St. Theresa Point, Island Lake and return to Winnipeg. On arrival at Sandy Lake at approximately 1549, the crew attempted to land but were unable to because of the low ceiling and visibility. They then diverted to St.Theresa Point, landing at 1630. The flight departed St. Theresa Point for Sandy Lake at 1720. The aircraft landed at approximately 1745 at Sandy Lake, where 22 passengers deplaned while four remained on board; the aircraft was not refuelled or otherwise serviced at Sandy Lake. During the stop, both engines were shut down. The aircraft took off from runway 29 at Sandy Lake at approximately 1805 and entered a right turn. Witnesses indicate that the aircraft appeared to fly at a lower than normal height throughout the turn. After turning through approximately 120 degrees, the aircraft descended into 100-foot trees and crashed. The aircraft struck the ground about 1 nm northwest of the airport."
1085,ACC1059,"The Antonov An-124 was returning without cargo after completing its first commercial flight to Dubai, UAE. An intermediate stop was planned at Kerman Airport, Iran.Near Kerman, the flight was instructed to entered a holding pattern, but the flight crew failed to follow the established flight pattern in the holding area. The aircraft deviated to the north up to 47 km while descending from 8200 to 5200 m. The visibility for an approach to runway 34 was less than that established for this approach pattern. At a distance of 45 km, a turn to the opposite course was started and the descent was continued to 3300 m. After passing the airfield, the crew began the permitted descent from 3300 m, but did not complete a standard turn and left the approach pattern, continuing the flight towards the mountains up to 4100 m in the dark.At a speed of 385 km/h, the aircraft collided with a mountain slope at an altitude of 3400 m, crashed and caught fire."
1089,ACC1063,"The pilot took off from runway 09 at Tuktoyaktuk at 17:06:34, and had turned the aircraft to a southerly direction when the right engine lost all power. He decided to return to the airport. While manoeuvring back to the airport, the aircraft struck an ice-covered lake in a steep, 65 degrees nose-down attitude. The engines and front of the aircraft penetrated the approximately two-foot-thick layer of ice. The remainder of the fuselage, wings, and empennage remained on the ice surface."
1096,ACC1070,The Skyvan was coming in to land at Ampuriabrava with the no. 2 prop feathered. A go around was attempted but the Skyvan crashed into trees. The left wing broke off and the no. 1 engine tore through the cockpit.
1099,ACC1073,"While circling to land on runway 26, the crew performed a non-typical circling procedure at a lower than published altitude, leading to loss of control consistent with an accelerated stall, and descended into terrain. Whiteout conditions may have contributed."
1102,ACC1076,"On approach to Nalchik the flaps were set to 35 deg. The nose suddenly pitched up and down; control was lost and the An-12 crashed 4,5 km short of the runway. The aircraft was carrying a cargo of coins (13,5 t.) from St. Petersburg to Nalchik via Volgograd."
1105,ACC1079,"The aircraft departed Bankstown Airport, NSW (BWU) at about 06:40 and proceeded as planned to Inverell Airport, NSW (IVR) with several en route stops. At Inverell the pilot rested until his departure that afternoon for the return journey. At 17:23 the pilot departed Armidale (ARM) for Tamworth (TMW). The planned time for the flight was 17 minutes. The flight plan indicated the flight would be conducted in accordance with IFR procedures. The pilot elected to remain at 4,500 ft in visual meteorological conditions because of conflicting traffic at higher altitudes. The published IFR lowest safe altitude for the route was 5,400 ft.At about 17:32 the pilot requested a descent clearance. He was cleared to make a visual approach with a clearance limit of 5 NM DME from Tamworth, and was requested to report at 8 DME from Tamworth. The pilot acknowledged the instructions and reported leaving 4,500 ft on descent.The aircraft was 8.2 NM from Tamworth when it impacted trees at approximately 2,685 ft AMSL. It was descending at an angle of approximately 3.5 degrees, and was banked about 17.5 degrees to the left at impact. The aircraft maintained a straight path after initial impact but had rolled to a bank angle of 25 degrees left by the time the left wing struck a second tree 35 m further on. It then impacted the ground left wing low and inverted, before bouncing into a rock face 200 m from initial impact. The main fuselage wreckage caught fire and the cabin area was destroyed.There was low cloud and rain in the area at the time of the accident."
1106,ACC1080,"The crew had arrived in Key West Harbor with 13 passengers about 10:10, and had disembarked the passengers. The crew moored the airplane and had gone ashore. The crew returned to the airplane about 11:30, and were planning on a short flight to Key West Airport for the purpose of refueling. The first officer was the pilot flying, and the checklist for start, run-up, and takeoff was partially accomplished. Shortly after liftoff the airplane was observed by witnesses to pitch up abruptly. The captain, and first officer noted the nose pitching up, and the captain stated that they ""might have a lot of water in the tail"", and the first officer then stated ""a lot of water"". The crew was then heard to attempt to overcome the nose up pitch until impact."
1107,ACC1081,"On February 21, 1994, the right engine of N3433Y experienced a misfire and loss of power while on final approach to Spokane, WA. The airplane was grounded for maintenance and the right engine was removed and replaced with an overhauled engine from Precision Airmotive. Precision Airmotive reported that the overhaul was completed and approved for service on December 20, 1993 and preserved for short term storage. Prior to the overhaul the engine had been on the shelf in long term storage. At the time of the accident, the operator reported that the engine had accumulated a total time of 15 hours since the overhaul. On March 18, 01:53 hours, the captain reported to the Spokane controller that the flight was ready for takeoff on runway 21. The controller instructed the flight to, after takeoff, fly a heading of 215 degrees to Portland, and it was cleared for takeoff. Shortly after takeoff the crew were forced to shut down the right engine because of a failure. They tried to return to the airport but the plane collided with the terrain in an open level field located 3,450 feet from the end of runway 21 and 900 feet to the right of runway centerline. The airplane was lying on its belly, with the main landing gear retracted. The entire fuselage and cargo, cockpit, and inboard section of both wings was consumed by fire."
1108,ACC1082,Crashed.
1111,ACC1085,"On the day before the accident, the Islander aircraft flew from Aurukun to Weipa with the chief pilot occupying the left pilot seat and the pilot involved in the accident occupying the right pilot seat. At Weipa the chief pilot left the aircraft,instructing the other pilot to fly some practice circuits before returning the aircraft to Aurukun. Before commencing the circuits and the return flight to Aurukun, the aircraft's two main tanks each contained 100 L of fuel and the two wing tip tanks each contained about 90 L of fuel.On the day of the accident the pilot added 200 L of fuel at Aurukun to the aircraft's tanks and then flew the aircraft and the passengers to Weipa. About 50 minutes before sunset, the aircraft taxied for departure from runway 30 for the 25-minute return flight to Aurukun.When the aircraft was about 300 ft above ground level after takeoff, a witness reported that all engine sounds stopped and that the aircraft attitude changed from a nose-high climb to a more level attitude. A short time later, the noise of engine power surging was heard. The aircraft rolled left and entered a spiral descent. It struck level ground some 350 m beyond the departure end of runway 30 and 175 m to the left of the extended centreline."
1112,ACC1086,Cessna Caravan JA8898 departed Okayama at 18:28 for a flight to Hiroshima. It was dark and it was raining a little when the pilot approached Hiroshima.The Caravan flew into the southeastern slope of the Noboru Lu mountain (542 m high) at the 450 m level. The aircraft crashed into trees and caught fire.The pilot was not accustomed to night flying and also may have been impaired a little as a result of alcoholic beverages.
1113,ACC1087,"Rwanda's president, Juvénal Habyarimana, and Burundian president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, were killed when the Falcon 50 corporate jet crashed after being hit by a missile while on final approach to Kigali. Both presidents were returning from a meeting in Tanzania to consider ways to implement an agreement setting up a transitional government in Rwanda, intended to be in place until multi-party elections could be held. This meant that power would be shared between the Hutu population of Rwanda and the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). Hutu extremist members of the presidents inner circle viewed the agreement as an existential threat to a Hutu-dominated Rwanda as well as their own political and economic standing. These men were not simply opposed to a reconciliation process; they were committed to the wholesale extermination of Tutsis.One of these men was Théoneste Bagosora. Colonel Bagosora was intimately familiar with the presidents travel schedule and sufficiently powerful that the night before the summit, he was able to change the composition of the Rwandan delegation to ensure that Army Chief of Staff General Déogratias Nsabimana -who opposed Bagosoras genocidal plans- would be on the president's plane.Using a proprietary radio network, Bagosora was in direct contact with elements of the presidential guard, the para­commando battalion, and most importantly, the Anti­Aircraft Battalion (LAA). These units were located in Kanombe Camp, near Kanombe International Airport in Kigali.The LAA, which Bagosora personally commanded for several years, was not only responsible for the security of the airport, but had anti-aircraft weapons stationed in the immediate vicinity.Through their private communication channel, the conspirators tracked the progress of the president's Falcon 50 aircraft from the moment it left Dar es Salaam to return to Kigali. As it flew west toward the airport, the conspirators fired two SAMs from an area just east of the runway and toward the northern part of Kanombe Camp. At least one of the missiles struck the left wing and fuselage, causing the plane to crash into the grounds of the president's Kanombe residence.The death of Hutu President Habyarimana triggered a massive wave of genocide in Rwanda that finally ended in July 1994."
1115,ACC1089,"The Caravan departed Itaituba (ITB) at 06:40 on a flight to Jacareacanga (JCR). Jacareacanga Radio was contacted five minutes later. The crew were informed that visibility was poor: ceiling at 0 feet with a visibility of 300 meters, which was below minimums. The Caravan circled the airport to wait for the weather to improve. At 07:37 Jacareacanga Radio tried to contact the flight, but no answer was received. It appeared that the airplane had flown into the ground.Investigation revealed that the pilot was underqualified. The flight was being operated as an air taxi flight, which meant that it had to be piloted by an ATPL pilot. The pilot however just had a PPL and did not have an IFR rating."
135,ACC109,Crashed into thick jungle on the edge of the Izeze River.
1116,ACC1090,"The  Metro II passenger plane, operated by Aero Cuahonte, was destroyed when it struck a high ground after trying to land Uruapan Airport, Mexico. Visibility at the airport was limited, so the controller instructed the flight to carry out an instrument approach. The flight crew however insisted in attempting a visual approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned due to limited visibility. The pilot then executed a right-hand procedural turn to attempt another approach to runway 02. This approach was abandoned as well. The pilot now attempted to visually line up with runway 20 by making a left-hand turn. This was contrary to the approach procedures at Uruapan. The aircraft then impacted a mountain at 3937 ft (1200 m).Weather at Uruapan was reported as: visibility 4nm; half cloudy ceiling at 800 ft; clouds at 1200 feet and overcast at 2000 feet."
1119,ACC1093,"Blowing sand at the destination Tidjikja forced the crew to abandon earlier attempts to land. The aircraft touched down heavily, causing the undercarriage to fail. The F-28 slid off the side of the runway until bursting into flames when it struck a rock outcrop."
1122,ACC1096,The Lockheed P2V-7 air tanker crashed after dropping a partial load of retardant on the Butler Creek Fire. The crew apparently became fixated on the malfunction of the retardant-release doors and did not realize the tanker was entering a narrow box canyon. The airplane struck steeply rising terrain below the ridge top.
1123,ACC1097,The aircraft was reportedly shot down and crashed in a forest near Saborsko.
1127,ACC1101,"The Twin Otter took off from Fish Egg Inlet logging camp for a 16nm VFR flight to Pruth Bay. The aircraft climbed though 100 feet, and just as the flaps were retracting, a violent pitch up was experienced. The aircraft stalled, crashed into the water 100 feet offshore and sank immediately."
1128,ACC1102,"On September 22, 1994, a Purus Aerotaxi Embraer Bandeirante landed at Feijó Airport (FEJ). Upon landing the copilot inadvertently mishandled the engines. Reverse pitch was not applied. Directional control was lost and the left main landing gear ran off the side of the runway. The airplane came to rest 40 m past the end of the runway. It was towed to the ramp and the captain performed an inspection of the plane. He notified his company base and decided to continue to Tarauacá (TRQ) and Rio Branco (RBR). The first stretch was a short 10-minute flight, which was to be flown with the landing gear down as a precaution.The aircraft took off from Feijó at 06:30, carrying a load of 635 kg. A couple of minutes after takeoff the no. 2 engine developed problems. Altitude could not be maintained and the aircraft descended towards some trees. To diminish the drag, pilot raised the gear, but it was already too late. The right wing tip collided with a tree, ripping off 3,20 meters of the wing. The airplane rolled and crashed inverted."
1129,ACC1103,"The aircraft wasn't able to land at Tura due to bad weather there. After three missed approaches, the crew changed course to Vanavara, the alternate at 450 km SSE of Tura. At 41 km NNW of Vanavara (3,5 hours after leaving Krasnoyarsk), the three engines ran down. A forced landing was attempted on River Chamba, but the aircraft struck the river bank and crashed."

1132,ACC1106,"Rostov Aviation Enterprises Flight D9-156 was hijacked on October 25, 1994, while en route from Ashgabad, Turkmenistan, to Rostov, Russia, via Makhachkala, Russia. The hijacker claimed to have an explosive device. The pilot reported the incident shortly after the Yakovlev 40 aircraft left Makhachkala following a scheduled intermediate stop. The plane returned to Makhachkala. The hijacker refused to negotiate directly with authorities but used crew members as intermediaries. He demanded USD 2 million and transport to Iran. The hijacked aircraft landed at approximately 22:30. Some passengers were released shortly thereafter; however, additional hostages were not freed until approximately 14:00, October 26. By 18:00 all passengers had been released, and only the hijacker and two or three crew members remained on board. Part of the ransom -USD 800,000- was paid in order to secure the release of these hostages. Shortly after midnight on October 27, they, too, were released. Near dawn, as security forces prepared to storm the aircraft, the hijacker detonated a home-made explosive device and killed himself. Although the plane was damaged, there were no other casualties or injuries. Passengers on the plane reported that the hijacker had a knife, a hand grenade with an exposed fuse, and a home-made explosive device."
1133,ACC1107,"During takeoff from Batagay Airport, Russia, the airplane pitched up. The captain turned his head and made gestures to the passengers in the rear to move forward in order to shift the Centre of Gravity.Loosening his grip on the controls allowed the nose to pitch up even further. The airspeed dropped. The pilot then reduced engine power to perform a forced landing but the airplane stalled and impacted terrain. A small fire erupted, but this was quickly contained.It appeared there were four unregistered passengers on the flight, three adults and one child. The baggage weight was underestimated by 139 kg. Calculations concluded that the airplane must have been 503 kg over the allowed maximum takeoff weight with a centre of gravity at 38,2% were a maximum of 33% is allowed."
1135,ACC1109,"The aircraft was destroyed when it flew into the side of a mountain whilst enroute from Nabire to Obana.

Weather at the destination was poor due to rain in the area. On final approach the crew lost sight of the runway. The copilot suggest the initiate a go around, but the captain continued the approach at very low altitude. Noticing the treetops, the copilot advanced the throttles to go around, but the captain intervened and retarded the throttles. The aircraft touched down about half way down the runway on the left-hand edge. The pilot used the thrust reverser and applied the brakes, but these were not effective on the wet runway. The aircraft overran the runway and ended up in the river."

1165,ACC1139,"Approaching Reno (RNO), the pilot received an instrument clearance to perform a Localizer DME-1, runway 16R, approach, which the FAA had previously approved for the operator's use. The localizer centreline passed over a 6,161-foot (1885 m) msl mountain, which was depicted on the chart. The pilot was familiar with the area, having transported cargo from Sacramento to Reno for 5 days each week since December, 1994. IMC existed and light snow showers were present. ATC issued the pilot a series of instructions as he was radar vectored toward the final approach fix (FAF), which had a minimum crossing altitude of 6,700 feet (2050 m) msl. The pilot misstated four of the instructions during clearance read backs and was corrected by ATC each time. Contact with the pilot was lost following issuance of his landing clearance. The airplane impacted the mountainside at an elevation of about 6,050 feet (1851 m), while tracking inbound near the centreline of the localizer course, about 2.7 nautical miles before reaching the FAF."

1174,ACC1148,"At 08:17 Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 departed Auckland (AKL) as scheduled bound for Palmerston North (PMR).To the north of Palmerston North the pilots briefed themselves for a VOR/DME approach to runway 07 which was the approach they preferred. Subsequently Air Traffic Control specified the VOR/DME approach for runway 25, due to departing traffic, and the pilots re-briefed for that instrument approach. The IMC involved flying in and out of stratiform cloud, but continuous cloud prevailed during most of the approach. The aircraft was flown accurately to join the 14 nm DME arc and thence turned right and intercepted the final approach track of 250° M to the Palmerston North VOR. During the right turn, to intercept the inbound approach track, the aircrafts power levers were retarded to 'flight idle' and shortly afterwards the first officer advised the captain "".... 12 DME looking for 4000 (feet)"". The final approach track was intercepted at approximately 13 DME and 4700 feet, and the first officer advised Ohakea Control ""Ansett 703"" was ""established inbound"". Just prior to 12 miles DME the captain called ""Gear down"". The first officer asked him to repeat what he had said and then responded ""OK selected and on profile, ten - sorry hang on 10 DME were looking for four thousand arent we so - a fraction low"". The captain responded, ""Check, and Flap 15"". This was not acknowledged but the first officer said, ""Actually no, were not, ten DME were..... (The captain whistled at this point) look at that"". The captain had noticed that the right hand main gear had not locked down: ""I dont want that."" and the first officer responded, ""No, thats not good is it, so shes not locked, so Alternate Landing Gear...?"" The captain acknowledged, ""Alternate extension, you want to grab the QRH?"" After the First Officers ""Yes"", the captain continued, ""You want to whip through that one, see if we can get it out of the way before its too late."" The captain then stated, ""Ill keep an eye on the airplane while youre doing that."" The first officer located the appropriate ""Landing Gear Malfunction Alternate Gear Extension"" checklist in Ansett New Zealands Quick Reference Handbook (QRH) and began reading it. He started with the first check on the list but the captain told him to skip through some checks. The first officer responded to this instruction and resumed reading and carrying out the necessary actions. It was the operators policy that all items on the QRH checklists be actioned, orproceeded through, as directed by the captain. The first officer started carrying out the checklist. The captain in between advised him to pull the Main Gear Release Handle. Then the GPWSs audio alarm sounded. Almost five seconds later the aircraft collided with terrain. The Dash 8 collided with the upper slope of a low range of hills."

After taking off from Ciudad Obregón at 20:01 hours, the flight reported that it was cancelling its flight plan and returning to the departure airport. After the second take off at 21:18, the flight plan was canceled again as the crew wanted to divert to Tepic. While en route the destination was changed to Guadalajara. However, the controller informed the flight that Guadalajara Airport was closed.The flight crew then opted to divert to Tepic again, maintaining continuous communication with the Mazatlán Center controller. The last communication with the aircraft was that it had the lights of the Tepic Airport in sight. No contact was established with the Tepic Tower. The aircraft crashed a few kilometers from the airport, resulting in fatal injuries to the crew.One of the surviving passengers was a Mexican drug lord, Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, who was arrested after the accident."

1188,ACC1162,"The flight was the second Metro III type-conversion training flight for the co-pilot. Earlier that night, he had completed a 48-minute flight.During the briefing prior to the second flight, the check-and-training pilot indicated that he would give the co-pilot a V 1 cut during the takeoff. The co-pilot questioned the legality of conducting the procedure at night. The check-and-training pilot indicated that it was not illegal because the company operations manual had been amended to permit the procedure. The crew then proceeded to brief the instrument approach which was to be flown following the V 1 cut. There was no detailed discussion concerning the technique for flying a V 1 cut.The co-pilot conducted the takeoff. Four seconds after the aircraft became airborne, the check-and-training pilot retarded the left engine power lever to flight-idle. The landing gear was selected up 11 seconds later. After a further 20 seconds, the aircraft struck the crown of a tree and then the ground about 350 m beyond the upwind end of the runway and 210 m left of the extended centreline. It caught fire and was destroyed. The co-pilot and another trainee on board the aircraft were killed while the check-and-training pilot received serious injuries."

According to the operator, the pilot filed an IFR flight plan for a 19:10 departure, requesting 16,000 feet MSL, via direct Monterrey, direct Coahila, with an estimated time en route of one hour and 20 minutes. The pilot estimated in his flight plan a fuel endurance of four hours. While 80 miles (128 km) from the destination airport, the pilot contacted the tower at the Piedras Negras Airport, and was informed that the airport was closed due to inclement weather, which was reported as sky obscured, visibility zero, with fog and drizzle. The airport was served with an NDB. No published approach are available for the airport; however, several local pilots confirmed that a local non-approved instrument procedure had been devised by local pilots. The pilot probably attempted this handwritten chart for an approach to the airport. The flaps were extended in the approach position as the aircraft contacted terrain and crashed."
1194,ACC1168,"Nigeria Airways flight WT357 departed Yola (YOL) at 07:00 en route to Lagos (LOS). Intermediate stops were planned at Jos (JOS) and Kaduna (KAD). The Boeing 737 landed at Jos at 07:40 and departed fifty minutes later. The flight to Kaduna was uneventful. Kaduna ATC gave the aircraft an inbound clearance with no delay for a locator approach to runway 05. Though, the initial landing clearance was for runway 05, the captain requested to land on runway 23. He was reminded by the controller that the wind was from 090 magnetic, but he still insisted on using the 23 approach. At 08:42, the aircraft commenced its initial descent at 48 miles on the ILS/DME to 4,500 ft. At 08:49 UTC, it was cleared to 3,500 ft at 10 miles out and was later descended to 500 ft. The aircraft turned left from the track 310 to align with runway 23 and the aircraft was still in the turn when the threshold was sighted just 1.5 miles to the left of the aircraft. The first officer asked the captain ""Can you make it to land from that position?"". The observer in the jump seat also suggested going on the downwind, presumably to re-position the aircraft for landing on runway 05. There was no response at all from the captain and the approach was continued for runway 23. The left turn was very steep and it took the aircraft to the left of the runway centreline and a right correction was applied. The observer shouted ""Watch the wing"" as the wings could have struck the ground on the final approach. By this time, the aircraft crossed the threshold with the flying pilot still struggling to maintain directional control for runway centreline alignment.The aircraft touched down 7820 feet down the runway, leaving just 2020 ft (615.85 m) of runway length. The captain was reported to have used 1.8 and 1.6 EPR on the reversers. When a runway overrun became inevitable, the captain turned the aircraft to the left with the intention to take advantage of the last rapid exit intersection to avoid the runway end lights.At this juncture, the aircraft entered an uncontrollable skid. The right wing hit the ground, thus rupturing the fuel tanks and a huge fire erupted. The aircraft was destroyed by the fire."
1196,ACC1170,"A Boeing 737-2K9 passenger plane, operated by Cameroon Airlines, was destroyed in an accident at Douala, Cameroon. Five of the 76 occupants survived the accident.The Boeing 737, named ""Nyong"", operated on a passenger flight from Cotonou, Benin to Douala, Cameroon. The flight departed at 20:22 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL330. The en route and descent were uneventful. At 21:32 UTC the flight was cleared for an approach to runway 30. Nine minutes later the flight reported 3,5 NM out at 1100 feet with runway in sight. The tower controller then cleared the flight to land. The aircraft overflew the runway threshold and started to climb. The flight radioed that they were 'having problems' and that they would report back. The tower controller then saw the aircraft in a sharp left hand turn. The airplane descended until it impacted a mangrove swamp."

The estimated time of arrival at Morogoro was 04:49 hours. 5H-TZD maintained communications with the Dar es Salaam Tower and was cleared to flight Level 60 to the TMA boundary. At 04:40 hours 5H-TZD advised that he was estimating TMA at 04:41 hours at FL60. The estimate for Morogoro was revised to 04:51 hours and was to call on ""top of descent"". No further transmission was heard from the aircraft.The wreckage of the aircraft was discovered top of Palapala Mountains (Uluguru Mountain Range) on 5 May 1996 after extensive search. The aircraft was completely destroyed by impact and the subsequent fire.It is concluded that the accident was caused by the aircraft colliding with high ground approximately 5 N.M. short of the runway. The decision of the pilot to initiate descent in weather conditions which allowed no visual contact with the high terrain was the major contributory factor."
1226,ACC1200,"The pilot-in-command, who was also the owner of Buffalo Narrows Airways, had just purchased the aircraft from Taquan Air in Ketchikan. He intended to ferry the Otter to their base of operations in Buffalo Narrows. The aircraft flew into a mountain at 7000 feet in marginal weather conditions."

While turning to finals the aircraft was blown through the centerline, forcing the pilot to abandon the approach. He climbed to 550 feet and positioned the airplane for another approach. For this second attempt the pilot extended the downwind leg by approximately 800 metres before turning towards the airfield. A rapid turn to finals with a steep bank angle was performed during which the aircraft descended. In a right wing low attitude of some 70°and a nose low attitude of approximately 20° the aircraft collided with grass covered gently rising terrain, 1,5 km South of the runway. Its groundspeedat this time was estimated at 125 kt."

The captain then ordered the propeller the be feathered. At 14:57 the first officer confirms that number 3 actually feathered, but said they were still indicating a fire. The captain then decided to carry out an emergency landing at Holy Cross. While the captain was preparing the airplane for landing the first officer stated that the fire is starting to go out. METO power was applied and the captain remarked that if the fire is out he would rather not land at Holy Cross. The fire warning bell sounded again at 14:59 and smoke began entering the cockpit. An approach was made to Russian Mission and the aircraft passed over the airport at 300-400 feet and was later seen turning to finals when the right wing folded upward. The aircraft rolled to the right and nosed down into the ground, short of runway 35."
1240,ACC1214,"The Twin Otter was carrying six barrels of Jet B fuel for a helicopter company to Markham Bay, an off-strip landing site. and touched down just after the threshold. The aircraft became airborne 18 m further on and bounced two times before touching down for the last time. The brakes were applied, but power was increased later in an attempt to takeoff again. The aircraft became airborne when the ground fell away beyond the runway and flew for 1000 feet before striking a rock with the main gear. The gear was sheared off and the Twin Otter stalled and crashed onto a rocky beach."
1241,ACC1215,"The DC-4 aircraft, named 'Yukon Trader' was on a VFR flight from a remote mining strip at Bronson Creek, Canada to Wrangell, USA with a crew of three and about 16,600 pounds of cargo on board. At an altitude of 1,500 feet after takeoff the crew heard a whining noise. They switched inverters, but the problem persisted. Electrical instrument indications in the cockpit then became erratic, and the number 2 engine began to misfire; its fire warning light in the cockpit illuminated briefly. The crew carried out the engine fire drill; however, the fire did not extinguish. The captain commenced a right-hand turn to return to the Bronson Creek airstrip, and announced to the crew that the number 2 engine had separated from the wing. The captain applied maximum power to the three remaining engines; however, the aircraft began to lose altitude. Both pilots held the rudder and aileron controls at full right deflection in an attempt to prevent the aircraft from yawing or rolling to the left. The aircraft was shaking violently at that time, and the crew members were unable to read any of the engine or flight instruments. At about 50 feet above ground level, just short of the Iskut River, the pilots closed the throttles. The aircraft descended rapidly, and the burning left wing struck a tree just as the fuselage contacted the surface of the river. The three occupants escaped the burning aircraft, and the first officer and load master swam to safety. The captain is missing and is presumed to have drowned."

Destination was Lae, with en route stops at Banz, Minj, Chimbu, Goroka and Kainantu. The service proceeded uneventfully via the first four intermediate stops and the aircraft departed Goroka for Kainantu at 08:52 hours with nine passengers, including four children, on board. The flight plan for this sector indicated that the aircraft would take 15 minutes to fly the 25 miles from Goroka to Kainantu and the proposed cruising level was 7,500 feet above mean sea level or approximately 1,500 feet above the general level of the en-route terrain. The aircraft was following the normal route from Goroka, but flying very low and just beneath the extremely low cloud that persisted in the area. Flying right at the base of the overcast, the aircraft then entered a saddle in a ridge that lay at right angles to its track. Almost immediately afterwards, the engine noise increased and the aircraft banked steeply into a turn to the left.The turn continued through about 180 degrees until the aircraft, just clearing the slopes of the northern side of the saddle, was heading back in the direction from which it had come. But before it could regain the area of lower terrain to the west of the ridge, the aircraft flew into a stand of tall trees on top of a spur in the saddle. Cutting a swathe through the trees the aircraft cleared the top of the spur itself and crashed on to a grass covered slope on its western side."

149,ACC123,"The Aero Spacelines 377MGT was a converted Boeing Stratocruiser. Prototype N111AS first flew on March 13, 1970. In the following period flight testing was carried out, a.o. at Edwards AFB. The accident occurred during the sixth takeoff of Flight Number 12 following the scheduled shutdown of the engine number one at about 109 knots IAS. The takeoff was being made on runway 22 and the wind was from approximately 200 degrees at about 10 knots. Rotation occured at about 114 knots and several seconds after rotation, according to one witness, the aircraft turned and rolled to the left, settling as it did so. The left wingtip subsequently contacted the ground, causing a severe yaw. The forward fuselage struck the ground, causing the flight deck to be destroyed."

The pilot acknowledged the instructions. About 1 minute later, communication and radar contact with the airplane were lost. Eye witnesses near the accident site observed the airplane as it descended below the cloud layer. The airplane was described as being in a steep left bank with the nose down. Witnesses also stated that the engines were revving. Within seconds of the visual sighting, the airplane crashed. Examination of the airframe failed to disclose a mechanical problem. No fire or smoke was seen coming from the airplane before it crashed. The pilot did not report experiencing a problem with the airplane to the tower controller. Toxicology tests of the pilot indicated O.323 mcg/ml chlorpheniramine (a sedating antihistamine) in liver fluid and 0.073 mcg/ml chlorpheniramine in kidney fluid. Also, unspecified levels of dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), pseudoephedrine (a decibgestabt), and phenylpropanolamine (a decongestant) were reported in kidney and liver fluids.

1303,ACC1277,"Flight 301 departed St. Andrews at 14:15 CST on a 40-minute, scheduled flight to Little Grand Rapids. The flight was pilot self-dispatched and departed under visual flight rules (VFR) in controlled airspace. When the aircraft approached Little Grand Rapids, the crew received the unofficial airport weather report by radio from the airport manager. The weather was reported as a ceiling of 200 feet agl and a visibility of one statute mile, and the crew flew an instrument approach. A missed approach procedure was carried out and the aircraft climbed back above the cloud layer. The crew then heard that a company Piper Navajo had landed on runway 18, visibility on finals being 2 miles. The Bandeirante crew then began a second approach, descending to an altitude of 150 feet. The track followed by the aircraft was east of the normal approach path and at low level. Power was applied just before the aircraft banked rapidly to the left, followed by a nearly immediate right bank and impact with the terrain. The aircraft descended into the trees in a shallow left bank approximately 400 feet south and 1 600 feet to the east of the approach to runway 36. It was found a.o. out that at both takeoff and landing, the aircraft was about 1 000 pounds heavier than the relevant maximum allowable weight. Also, the GPS installed in C-GVRO was not approved as a primary navigational aid. The available information indicates that the flight crew used the GPS as a primary navigational aid during the last approach to Little Grand Rapids."
1304,ACC1278,"Tajikistan Airlines Flight 3183 was a charter flight from Dushanbe (DYU) to Sharjah (SHJ). After entering the United Arab Emirates airspace, the crew of the Tu-154 contacted Dubai Approach. Traffic was handled by Dubai because Sharjah did not have a surveillance radar. The crew received radar vectors and consecutive descent clearances from 17000 to 10000, 6000 and 2500 feet with a corrective turn to the course of 190°.While the Tu-154 descended through a height of 3460 feet the crew were cleared further down to 1500 feet. At 1800 feet the aircraft entered an area of turbulence. The height of 1500 feet was reached at a point almost 16 km from the runway. The crew did not report reaching this height, but at the same time Dubai Approach instructed the crew to turn to a heading of 270 degrees in preparation for an ILS approach to runway 30.While turning to the right, at a speed of 400 km/h, the landing gear was lowered. As the aircraft descended through 820 ft, an aural ""bank angle"" warning sounded, which ceased as the crew decreased the bank angle from 20 degrees to 14°. Descending through 690 ft, the crew again encountered turbulence. While preparing the aircraft for the final approach and landing the crew did not pay attention to their altitude. Suddenly one of the crew members noticed that they were too low and requested power to be added, but it was too late.The aircraft struck desert terrain, broke up and caught fire."
1310,ACC1284,"The aircraft reportedly suffered a no. 2 engine failure on takeoff. The F-27 swerved to the right off the runway, collided with an embankment and caught fire."
1316,ACC1290,"When the crew boarded the aircraft in Hsinchu for the flight to Kaohsiung it had been a long and demanding day for the captain who was to fly the aircraft. He had been on duty more than 11 hours and performed nine flights. The accident flight, which was planned to be his last flight of the day, was to take place in darkness. The weather was above minima but IMC. During the pre-flight check the crew noted a failure in the RH Main Bus. This caused a number of systems to be unavailable, a.o.: the autopilot, the left hand EFIS, LH/RH Flight Director, LH RMI, EFIS Comparators, and the no. 2 engine anti-ice start bleed valve being open (as a result of this, the ITT on this engine was approximately 15°C higher than normal at selected power on this engine). Despite the fact that, according to the Minimum Equipment List (MEL), taking off for a flight with any of the Main Buses inoperative was not allowed, the captain decided to continue.During taxi to runway 05 the aircraft was cleared for a Chunan One (CN1) departure. The aircraft took off at 19:29:09. Because of the autopilot was not available, the captain now had to fly manually. In addition, the flying had to be performed without support from the yaw-damper that was also inoperative as a result of the RH Main Bus failure. This means that more active rudder control was required, while the DFDR-data shows that such input was not made.The more than 30°C ITT-split between the engines, of which approximately 15°C was caused by the RH Engine Anti-ice Start Bleed Valve being open, did have little effect on the behavior of the aircraft in the initial start-sequence. But when the crew, 30 seconds after lift off, disengaged CTOT and started to manually adjust the RH PLA downwards, possibly to get equal ITT in the engines, this ended up in a torque-split of more than 13% between the engines, with the RH engine being lower in torque. This asymmetry tended to yaw and roll the aircraft to the right and required higher aileron input than normal to the left in order to keep the aircraft at a constant bank angle. Normally the flaps are retracted at around 1,000 feet during initial climb. In this flight the flap retraction was not initiated until the first officer was reading the Climb Check List in which the flap position should be checked and verified. Flap retraction was done just prior to the aircraft reaching VFE15 (175 KIAS, which is the maximum allowed speed with flaps extended).When the climb power was set, a symmetric PLA change was made. However, due to the earlier RH Power Lever Angle (PLA) pull in combination with the normal backlash in the power lever cables between the PLA and the HMU, the RH engine torque was decreased while the LH engine torque remained unchanged. Hence, a torque split occurred. This resulted in an increased aerodynamic asymmetry giving a force tending to yaw and bank the aircraft to the right. Consequently, still more aileron input was required in order to maintain a correct bank angle.Because the behavior of the aircraft was very different from what the captain was used to, the need for continuous manual flying under IMC-conditions may have totally occupied his capacity. This could also explain why, during this phase of flight, he did not observe the aircraft starting a turn to the right 78 seconds after take off instead of continuing the left turn for a heading of 260. At about this same time, and for no obvious reasons, the positive rate of climb decreased and the aircraft leveled out at approximately 2,000 feet for a short time instead of continuing the climb to its assigned altitude of 3,000 feet. The captain's actions could be interpreted as signs that he might have been suffering from fatigue or spatial disorientation.It is difficult to determine if the F/O was aware of the captain's deviation from the cleared departure route. All indications point to the fact that he was not aware or that he out of respect for the captain did not report of the deviations. For example, the F/O transmitted back to Taipei Approach 114 seconds after takeoff, ""Left 230, Bravo 12255,"" while at the same time the aircraft was in a right turn with a 21 degree right bank, passing through a heading of 312 degrees. In fact, his primary means for monitoring the flight were very limited due to dark, IMC-conditions since his EFIS instruments were black or flagged. This could also explain why the captain did not receive any support from the F/O about the flight becoming more and more uncontrolled. Not until 124 seconds after takeoff and 37 seconds prior to the last DFDR-recording did the captain state that he was having a problem with the heading and asked for help with the magnetic compass. At that time the aircraft was in a 24° right bank and 10° pitch up position and had a heading and roll rate by one degree per second. From that moment a continuous decrease in pitch angle was recorded down to -65,4° just prior to the impact. Just 19 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, with a heading of 022 and a bank angle of 36° to the right, the captain said ""Ask for a radar vector."" At this moment, he also initiates a short aileron input to the right, further increasing the bank angle.The other crewmembers did not answer or give any notable response to the captain's request for help with the magnetic compass. The reason might be that they also were very confused about the situation and unable to take any relevant action. When the captain, 14 seconds before the last DFDR-recording, said ""Wah Sei!!! Everything is wrong."" the aircraft was in a 8,4° pitch down and the right bank angle was 47,5°. Finally, only 10 seconds before the last data point was recorded, the first officer responds by asking ""Sir, shall we look at this one? "". Pitch down was then 15,8° and the right roll angle 71,7°. In the last part of the flight the pitch and bank angles were at extreme values not to be experienced in normal operation. At this stage of the flight, the control inputs recorded are rapid aileron inputs to the right that further increased the adverse attitudes. The aircraft was then totally uncontrolled and the airspeed and sink rate increased dramatically. Four seconds before impact the Vmo warning started. The aircraft then crashed into the sea."

Flight 4101 climbed to the cruising altitude of FL140. The copilot contacted ATC at Sevilla and received clearance to descend to FL70. Two minutes later the flight was further cleared to 5000 feet and the crew were instructed to contact Melilla Tower. The copilot reported to the Melilla Tower controller that they were 30 nm from the airport, descending to 5000 feet. Melilla Tower then reported that runway 33 was in use and reported wind at 270 degrees at 5 knots, visibility 8 km with few clouds at 1000 feet. At 06:45 the copilot reported that they were at 22nm at an altitude of 3000 feet. By now they had descended below the MSA of 4000 feet. The descent was continued and the airplane crossed the coast line at about 1100 feet. In IMC conditions the flight descended over mountainous terrain.

1353,ACC1327,"Regency Express Air flight 434 was on a night cargo flight from Vancouver (YVR) to Victoria (YYJ) and was operating under VFR. The aircraft departed from Vancouver's runway 08R at 00:12 PST and completed a climbing right-hand turn onto a direct track towards Active Pass. The aircraft leveled off at 2000 feet agl and remained at that altitude for all but the last portion of the flight. As the aircraft approached Active Pass, the crew made a radio call to inform any traffic in the Victoria area of their intention to join left-base for a landing on runway 09 at the Victoria airport. Several minutes later, the crew made a second report indicating that they were 10 nm (18,5 km) back, for a landing on runway 09. The last position report was made as they approached Beaver Point, at the south-east end of Saltspring Island. The aircraft then made a noticeable turn to the right, in the vicinity of Beaver Point, and began to track towards high ground north of the Victoria airport. At 00:26, the aircraft began a gradual, descending turn to the left onto a south-easterly heading, before striking trees near the peak of Mount Tuam on the southern end of Saltspring Island."
1355,ACC1329,"The Dash 7 plane had been in Egypt for 2,5 years, but had been stored there for some time. The aircraft was then re-possessed by DNK Leasing, registered in the Cayman Islands and ferried to Guernsey for extensive maintenance. The aircraft remained out of service at Guernsey airport for approximately one year whilst it underwent an extensive programme to ensure that all maintenance required during the previous two years had been fully implemented. This was found to be necessary because the extent of the work carried out during its period in Egypt was not clearly defined by the supporting documentation. The initial test flight was flown on 25 November 1998, and was satisfactory except that the aircraft did not achieve the requisite climb performance. It was established that No 3 engine was not producing the rated power. This engine was changed and an abbreviated test flight was planned for the 28 November 1998; it was intended that this flight would only cover those elements related to aircraft performance. Descending from FL100 , at around 7000 feet the no. 1 engine was shutdown. The other three operating engines were at a low power setting. The autopilot was engaged and the flaps were up. The aircraft was then leveled at 5000 feet. As the autopilot attempted to maintain level flight, the pitch attitude increased and the airspeed reduced at a rate of about 1×5 kt. At about 95 KIAS, with the autopilot still engaged and the elevator and the pitch trim continuing to provide a positive pitch-up demand, the pitch attitude started to decrease. The maximum pitch attitude achieved was 8°. The onset of vibrations occurred at about 97 KIAS. Coincident with this was a slight forward movement of the elevator, prior to this the elevator and pitch trim were consistently moving nose up together. The autopilot was not disconnected until 6 seconds later.The power was then increased on all three operating engines and the autopilot was disconnected. The elevator was 12° and the pitch trim 16.4°, both positive (pitch up) demands. The airspeed was 89 KIAS. The power continued to increase on the three operating engines and the aircraft began to roll to the left to a maximum of 80° angle of bank and this was opposed by the use of up to 54° right spoiler. The pitch attitude reduced to 54° nose down. Power was than reduced on the operating engines. The maximum rate of rotation about the yaw axis was 60°/sec. The DHC-7 spiraled down, crashed nose-down into a field and burst into a flames. The Dash 7 came down close to the A38 at Bickington near Ashburton."

1358,ACC1332,"Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft, which was climbing at approximately 500 feet above sea level, pitched up suddenly and became unstable when the flaps were retracted while entering the cloud layer. The pilot-in-command pushed the control column down to level the aircraft. After deciding that the aircraft could not safely continue the flight, he began turning left to return to Baie-Comeau. While turning, the aircraft rolled rapidly to the left and began to dive. The aircraft crashed into the St. Lawrence River."
1361,ACC1335,"Douglas DC-3C C-GWUG, was usually used on cargo flights between Vancouver and Nanaimo. Because of delayed arrival of a Purolator Boeing 727, the route of C-GWUG was changed to Vancouver-Victoria-Nanaimo, operating for Purolator Courier.Vancouver tower cleared the aircraft for takeoff at 06:22 PST from runway 26L. After takeoff, the aircraft turned left on a track toward Active Pass. During the departure climb, the captain requested an altitude of 1000 feet above sea level; the tower controller approved this request. The aircraft left the Vancouver control zone at 06:26 and entered Class E (controlled) airspace. As the aircraft approached the Gulf Islands, it descended slightly and remained level at 900 feet asl. It crossed about 0.25 nm west of the Active Pass NDB at 06:32 while remaining steady at 130 knots (ground speed) and level at 900 feet asl.At 0633:04, the aircraft descended to 800 feet asl for about nine seconds. The last radar data show the aircraft at 900 feet asl and 130 knots. At this altitude he aircraft initially struck trees on the ridge of Mount Parke and cut a swath through the treetops of about 200 feet long and 70 feet wide.

Shortly afterwards the flight crew detected smoke in the cockpit with a burning smell. An in-flight fire had erupted following the uncontained failure of the no. 4 engine. This forced the crew to carry out an emergency descent. At 20:43 at an altitude of 800 -1000 m the fire was extinguished. The captain decided to head to Kishinev for an emergency landing. Kishinev was 80 km away at that time. Meanwhile, hydraulic pressure dropped. At 20:49, at a distance of 55 km from the airport and at an altitude of 720-730 m, the no. propeller could no longer be feathered. Full left rudder was applied as well as full power on the remaining engines. Height could not be maintained and at 20:52 the captain decided to carry out a forced landing in a corn field at dusk, 24 minutes after sunset and 12 minutes before complete darkness.The airplane landed on oneven terrain, causing the fuselage to collapse. One seriously injured passenger died. Another three passengers were seriously injured. The navigator, radio operator, one flight attendant and 19 passengers were slightly injured. The remaining passengers and crew were not injured."
1366,ACC1340,"The flight departed Tonopah at 09:30 for a 73-mile VFR flight to Bishop. The aircraft was not carrying cargo at the time of the accident. The Beech failed to arrive at the destination; search efforts were initiated and the wreckage was subsequently found February 14 on the eastern slopes of White Mountain in the Inyo National Forest at 9,500 feet. A witnesses observed the aircraft flying between 7,000 and 8,000 feet msl as it entered Trace Plumas Canyon on White Mountain and begin a gradual left turn. The aircraft then disappeared from view. The canyon leads to the accident site. According to the operator, the pilot had successfully bid on a captain position on larger equipment and this was to be his last trip along this route. Several acquaintances of the pilot located at Tonopah reported that he intended to take a camera with him and photograph some scenic locations along this route."
1370,ACC1344,"China Southwest Airlines flight SZ4509, a Tupolev Tu-154M, departed Chengdu Airport in China at 14:35 hours on a domestic flight to Wenzhou. The en route altitude was 11400 meters. At 16:02 hours, when the aircraft passed 9000 meters in the descent towards Wenzhou, the crew felt that the steering column was too far forward. The crew were puzzled by the control issue, especially at 16:26 hours when the steering column was fully forward. Yet, the aircraft was not in a nose-down attitude. The captain noted that the controls felt disconnected. At 16:29 the flight was cleared to descend from 1200 m to 700 m. When the flight crew selected the first stage of flaps, an angle-of-attack warning sounded in the cockpit.  The aircraft entered a stall and began a steep descent until it impacted a farm field at Rui'an.Several farmers were injured by the flying debris."
1373,ACC1347,"Flight 960 operated under a defense visual flight rules flight plan and departed Goose Bay for Davis Inlet at 08:15 AST. During the first approach, the first officer had occasional visual glimpses of the snow on the surface. The captain descended the aircraft to the minimum descent altitude (MDA) of 1340 feet asl. When the crew did not acquire the required visual references at the missed approach point, they executed a missed approach. On the second approach, the captain flew outbound from the beacon at 3000 feet asl until turning on the inbound track. It was decided that if visual contact of the surface was made at any time during the approach procedure, they would continue below the MDA in anticipation of the required visual references. The captain initiated a constant descent at approximately 1500 feet per minute with 10 degrees flap selected. The FO occasionally caught glimpses of the surface. At MDA, in whiteout conditions, the captain continued the descent. In the final stages of the descent, the FO acquired visual ground contact; 16 seconds before impact, the captain also acquired visual ground contact. At 8 seconds before impact, the crew selected maximum propeller revolutions per minute. The aircraft struck the ice in controlled flight two nm from the airport. The aircraft was destroyed with wing and partial fuselage separation, and other incursion damage. The tail section where the ELT was mounted was badly damaged. Aircraft parts and cargo were scattered over the ice. The co-pilot was found approximately 20 feet from the main wreckage. He had expired before searchers reached the scene. The pilot was located in the rear of the aircraft, apparently thrown there during the crash sequence. He was semi-conscious with serious injuries. There was no fire."
1380,ACC1354,The aircraft crashed after takeoff from the Ol Kiombo airstrip in the Maasai Mara National Reserve to pick up passengers at another camp. Preliminary investigation results show that the flaps might not have been properly set for takeoff
1381,ACC1355,"American Airlines Flight 1420, from Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) to Little Rock (LIT), was scheduled to depart about 20:28 and arrive about 21:41. However, the airplane originally intended to be used for the flight was delayed in its arrival to Dallas/Fort Worth because of adverse weather in the area. After 21:00, the first officer notified gate agents that flight 1420 would need to depart by 23:16 because of Americans company duty time limitation. Another aircraft was arranged and the flight departed at 22:40.  En route and Descent About 22:54, the flight dispatcher sent the flight crew an ACARS message indicating that the weather around Little Rock might be a factor during the arrival. The dispatcher suggested that the flight crew expedite the arrival to beat the thunderstorms if possible, and the flight crew acknowledged this message. About 23:04, the Fort Worth center broadcast an NWS Convective SIGMET [significant meteorological information] weather advisory for an area of severe thunderstorms that included the Little Rock airport area. The flight crew discussed the weather and the need to expedite the approach. At 23:25:47, the captain stated, ""we got to get over there quick."" About 5 seconds later, the first officer said, ""I dont like that...thats lightning,"" to which the captain replied, ""sure is."" The flight crew had the city of Little Rock and the airport area in sight by 23:26. Fort Worth center cleared the flight to descend to 10,000 feet msl. The flight was transferred to the Memphis ARTCC and at 23:34, the flight crew contacted the Little Rock Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT). The controller advised the flight crew that a thunderstorm located northwest of the airport was moving through the area and that the wind was 280º at 28 knots gusting to 44 knots. The first officer told the controller that he and the captain could see the lightning. The controller told the flight crew to expect an ILS approach to runway 22L. At 23:36, the captain and first officer discussed American Airlines crosswind limitation for landing. The captain indicated that 30 knots was the crosswind limitation but realized that he had provided the limitation for a dry runway. The captain then stated that the wet runway crosswind limitation was 20 knots, but the first officer stated that the limitation was 25 knots. At 23:39:00, the controller cleared the flight to descend to an altitude of 3,000 feet msl. The controller then asked the flight crew about the weather conditions along the runway 22L final approach course, stating his belief that the airplanes weather radar was ""a lot better"" than the weather radar depiction available in the tower. At 23:39:12, the first officer stated, ""okay, we can...see the airport from here. We can barely make it out but we should be able to make [runway] two two...that storm is moving this way like your radar says it is but a little bit farther off than you thought."" The controller then offered flight 1420 a visual approach to the runway, but the first officer indicated, ""at this point, we really cant make it out. Were gonna have to stay with you as long as possible."" At 23:39:45, the controller notified flight 1420 of a windshear alert, reporting that the centerfield wind was 340º at 10 knots, the north boundary wind was 330º at 25 knots, and the northwest boundary wind was 010º at 15 knots. The flight crew then requested runway 04R so that there would be a headwind, rather than a tailwind, during landing. At 23:40:20, the controller instructed the flight crew to fly a heading of 250º for vectors to the runway 04R ILS final approach course. After reaching the assigned heading, the airplane was turned away from the airport and clear of the thunderstorm that had previously been reported by the controller. Between 23:40:46 and 23:41:31, the first officer stated the localizer frequency and course, the decision altitude, the minimum safe altitude, and a portion of the missed approach procedure for runway 04R. The captain then asked the first officer, ""do you have the airport? Is that it right there? I dont see a runway."" At 23:42:27, the controller told the flight crew that the second part of the thunderstorm was apparently moving through the area and that the winds were 340º at 16 knots gusting to 34 knots. At 23:42:40, the first officer asked the captain whether he wanted to accept ""a short approach"" and ""keep it in tight."" The captain answered, ""yeah, if you see the runway. cause I dont quite see it."" The first officer stated, ""yeah, its right here, see it?"" The captain replied, ""you just point me in the right direction and Ill start slowing down here."" At 23:42:55, the first officer said, ""its going right over the...field."" The first officer then told the controller, ""well we got the airport. Were going between clouds. I think its right off my, uh, three oclock low, about four miles."" The controller then offered a visual approach for runway 04R, and the first officer accepted. At 23:43:11, the controller cleared flight 1420 for a visual approach to runway 04R and indicated ""if you lose it, need some help, let me know please."" At 23:43:35, the first officer stated, ""youre comin in. Theres the airport."" Three seconds later, the captain stated, ""uh, I lost it,"" to which the first officer replied, ""see its right there."" The captain then stated, ""I still dont see it...just vector me. I dont know."" At 23:43:59, the controller cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the winds were 330º at 21 knots. At 23:44:19, the captain stated, ""see were losing it. I dont think we can maintain visual."" At 23:44:30, the first officer informed the controller that visual contact with the airport had been lost because of a cloud between the airplane and the airport. The controller then cleared the airplane to fly a heading of 220º for radar vectors for the ILS approach to runway 04R and directed the flight to descend to and maintain 2,300 feet msl. At 23:45:47, the first officer told the controller ""were getting pretty close to this storm. well keep it tight if we have to."" The controller indicated to the flight crew that, ""when you join the final, youre going to be right at just a little bit outside the marker if thats gonna be okay for ya."" The captain stated, ""thats great,"" and the first officer told the controller, ""thats great with us."" At 23:46:39, the controller advised the flight crew that the airplane was 3 miles from the outer marker. At 23:46:52, the captain stated, ""aw, were goin right into this."" At the same time, the controller reported that there was heavy rain at the airport, the ATIS information in effect at the time was no longer current, the visibility was less than 1 mile, and the runway visual range (RVR) for runway 04R was 3,000 feet. The first officer acknowledged this information.  Final approach At 23:47:08, the controller again cleared flight 1420 to land and indicated that the wind was 350º at 30 knots gusting to 45 knots. The first officer then read back the wind information as 030º at 45 knots. At 23:47:22, the captain stated, ""three thousand RVR. We cant land on that."" Four seconds later, the first officer indicated that the RVR for runway 04R was 2,400 feet, and the captain then said, ""okay, fine."" At 23:47:44, the captain stated, ""landing gear down."" About 5 seconds later, the captain stated, ""and lights please."" At 23:47:53, the controller issued a second windshear alert for the airport, reporting that the centerfield wind was 350º at 32 knots gusting to 45 knots, the north boundary wind was 310º at 29 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 32 knots. This transmission was not acknowledged by the flight crew. At 23:48:10, the captain stated, ""add twenty [knots],"" to which the first officer replied, ""right."" At 23:48:12, the controller reported that the runway 04R RVR was now 1,600 feet. About 23:48:18, the captain indicated that the flight was established on final approach; 6 seconds later, the first officer informed the controller that the flight was established on the inbound portion of the ILS. The controller repeated the clearance to land; stated that the wind was 340º at 31 knots, the north boundary wind was 300º at 26 knots, and the northeast boundary wind was 320º at 25 knots; and repeated the RVR. At 23:48:41, the first officer acknowledged this information. The controller did not receive any further transmissions from flight 1420. At 23:49:02, the first officer asked the captain, ""want forty flaps?"" The captain indicated that he thought he had already called for the landing flaps, after which the first officer stated, ""forty now."" At 23:49:10, the controller informed the flight crew that the wind was 330º at 28 knots. Two seconds later, the captain stated, ""this is a can of worms."" The first officer stated, ""theres the runway off to your right, got it?"" at 23:49:24. The captain replied, ""no,"" to which the first officer stated, ""I got the runway in sight. Youre right on course. Stay where youre at."" The captain then stated, ""I got it. I got it."" At 23:49:32, the controller reported the wind to be 330º at 25 knots. At 23:49:53, the controller reported the wind to be 320º at 23 knots. From about 400 feet above field level (afl) the airplane drifted to the right. At 23:50:00, the first officer said, ""were way off."" The localizer deviation value was about one dot to the right at that point. About 1 second later, the captain stated, ""I cant see it."" About 3 seconds afterward, the first officer asked, ""got it?"" to which the captain replied, ""yeah I got it."" At 23:50:13 and :14, the GPWS radio altitude callout ""sink rate"" sounded.  Landing The airplane touched down on the runway about 23:50:20. About 23:50:22, the first officer stated ""were down;"" about 2 seconds later, he stated, ""were sliding."" Over a 7-second period after touchdown, both thrust reversers were deployed and the left and right engines engine pressure ratios (EPR) reached settings of 1.89 and 1.67, respectively. The thrust reversers were subsequently moved to the unlocked status (neither deployed nor stowed). The flight spoilers did not deploy symmetrically at touchdown. About the time that the brakes were applied, the thrust reversers were deployed again. At 23:50:32, the CVR recorded an unidentified voice in the cockpit stating ""on the brakes."" The left engine reached a maximum setting of 1.98 reverse EPR, and the right engine reached a setting of 1.64 reverse EPR. The left brake pedal was relaxed at 23:50:34 before returning to its full position 2 seconds later. About the time that the left brake pedal was relaxed, the reversers were returned to the unlocked status. As the right thrust reverser was being moved to the unlocked status, the right engine reached a maximum setting of 1.74 reverse EPR. At 23:50:36, a full aileron deflection was given. At 23:50:40, the left thrust reverser was moved back to the deployed position, but the right reverser moved briefly to the deployed position and then moved to the stowed position. According to FDR data, the left thrust reverser remained deployed, and the right thrust reverser remained stowed, for the remainder of the flight. After departing the end of the runway, the airplane struck several tubes extending outward from the left edge of the instrument landing system localizer array, located 411 feet beyond the end of the runway; passed through a chain link security fence; went down a rock embankment to a flood plain, located approximately 15 feet below the runway elevation; and collided with the structure supporting the runway 22L approach lighting system."
1383,ACC1357,"During takeoff from Long Haul Lake, the engine failed. An engineer was flown in to troubleshoot the problem. Water was drained from the main fuel-filter and carburettor sumps. Two run-ups were conducted following which the pilot and engineer tried to take off. Shortly after takeoff, the aircraft's engine abruptly lost power. The pilot's attempts to restart the engine were unsuccessful, and the aircraft descended into a stand of trees and struck the ground."
1395,ACC1369,"Asian Spirit Flight 100 departed Manila Domestic Airport at 08:34 for a flight to Cauayan, ETA there being 09:40. Last message and contact was at 09:19 when the flight contacted Cauayan stating that they were 96 km out and their new estimate of arrival of 09:37.Captain on the flight was Rolando Salandanan, with over 10,000 flying hours and former vice president for operations of Pacific Air."
163,ACC137,"The aircraft inadvertently entered a fog bank. The pilot, who did not have an instrument rating, lost spatial awareness. When the Islander broke the fog bank it was flying in a 45 degree bank angle. It contacted trees and crashed on the Haringvreter island in a lake called Veerse Meer."
1403,ACC1377,"The DC-3 was chartered to transport building materials to Ennadai Lake and was on the second flight of the day. The ice strip on the lake was 2700 feet approximate in length, 150 feet wide. The aircraft was observed to touch down nearly halfway along the ice strip, the tail of the aircraft remained in the air, and the aircraft took off almost immediately. The main landing gear was seen to retract. The aircraft reached the end of the runway then abruptly entered a steep, nose-up attitude, banked sharply to the left, turned left, and descended into the ice. The left wing made first contact with the ice. The aircraft rotated around the left wing and struck the ice in a steep, nose-down attitude about 400 feet from the end of the ice strip."
164,ACC138,The Tu-124 jet took off from Rostov-na-Donu (ROV) at 14:55. The airplane climbed to 9000 m and reported over Dnepropetrovsk at 15:31.Shortly afterward the airplane lost control and crashed.
1406,ACC1380,The aircraft crashed after takeoff in instrument conditions (fog). The pilot was not qualified for IFR flights.
1408,ACC1382,"Impacted the side of a mountain ridge about 100 feet from the 1,400-foot top while on a night visual approach to Kaunakakai."
1410,ACC1384,The local Gabonese Power Supply Company (S.E.E.G.) chartered a Beechcraft 1900 plane from the Avirex company for a flight from Libreville to Moanda.Last contact with the flight was when the flight was cleared to 4100 feet. The aircraft was later found to have crashed on approach to runway 14; weather included fog and mist.
1414,ACC1388,"Wuhan Airlines flight 343 departed Enshi for a flight to Wuhan. The aircraft entered an area of poor weather; rain and thunderstorm with associated windshear. The crew reportedly circled Wuhan for about 30 minutes to wait for the storm to pass. Wuhan's weather bureau recorded 451 thunderclaps in a 10-minute period as the plane circled. During the approach the first officer proposed to land at an alternate airport, but the captain decided to continue to Wuhan.The plane was caught by windshear and crashed near Sitai Village, Yongfeng Township. Half of the plane plunged into a farmhouse and the other half came to rest on a dike of the Han River. Sitai is located about 20 to 30 kilometers (12 to 18 miles) from Wuhan. Seven workers who were installing generators on a vessel were killed when the plane hit.The Yun-7 airliner had recorded 13,811 safe flight hours and completed 11,724 takeoffs and landings by the end of May, finishing two-thirds of its lifespan."
165,ACC139,"The Yak-40 passenger plane flew into the side of Mount Airy-Tash (2300 m) at an altitude of 2100 m during the descent towards Leninabad, Tajikistan.Descent had been initiated over mountainous terrain in IMC conditions while the crew was not aware of the exact position of the plane. The captain and copilot had limited IMC experience and poor navigational training."
1417,ACC1391,"The aircraft departed Bajhang at 10:11 for a 30-minute flight to Dhangadhi. Last radio contact was at 10:31. The aircraft was found to have collided with pine trees on the 4300 feet Jarayakhali hill on the Churia mountain range, also known as Sivalik Hills, before catching fire."
1418,ACC1392,"The float-equipped Cessna Caravan had dropped of some RCMP Emergency Response Team (ERT) members at Teslin Lake. The aircraft was maneuvered for takeoff when it suddenly grounded on a gravel bar. The ERT members, working with the aircrafts maintenance engineer who had been called in, eventually managed to free the aircraft. They had been working for nearly seven hours to free the plane. At 23:50, after the engineer had pumped the floats, the pilot started the aircraft and taxied down the lake for a short distance before returning to start the takeoff run. The pilot took off downwind and passed over an RCMP boat at about 100 feet, then entered a steep climb. At the top of the climb, it stalled and yawed to the left. The aircraft descended and struck the water in a near-vertical attitude. The wreckage sank to a depth of 66 feet (20 m)."
1419,ACC1393,"The aircraft was conducting a normal approach to runway 12 at Bahrain International Airport with auto-pilot/flight director disconnected upon visual contact with the runway. Approximately 1nm from touchdown, at about 600 feet amsl and at an airspeed of 185 mph the crew requested a left-hand orbit (360 degree turn) because they were too high and fast on the approach. During the tight (36degree bank angle) left hand turn the flaps were fully extended and the landing checklist completed. When the aircraft crossed the extended runway centerline the crew reported they wanted to abort the landing. A controller gave the crew clearance to climb to 2,500 feet at a 300-degree heading to prepare for another approach. The plane's speed began increasing to 185 knots as it began to climb to 1000 feet in a 5-degree nose-up attitude. During the go-around at approximately 1,000 feet, the aircraft entered a rapid descent, 15-degrees nose down. As the GPWS sounded, the captain ordered the flaps to be raised and moved the sidestick aft. The Airbus impacted the sea at a 6.5-degreee nose down angle, north of the airport. The plane's last recorded airspeed was about 280 knots.Two very remarkable accidents happened June 1950 within a period of just 3 days. On June 12 an Air France DC-4 descended into the sea while on a night-time approach to Bahrain. Two days later, another Air France DC-4 descended into the sea off Bahrain, also on a night-time approach."
1420,ACC1394,"A Beechcraft 200 Super King Air, VH-SKC, departed Perth Airport, WA (PER) at 10:09 UTC on a charter flight to Leonora Airport, WA (LNO) with one pilot and seven passengers on board. Until 10:32 the operation of the aircraft and the communications with the pilot appeared normal. However, shortly after the aircraft had climbed through its assigned altitude, the pilot's speech became significantly impaired and he appeared unable to respond to ATS instructions. Open microphone transmissions over the next 8-minutes revealed the progressive deterioration of the pilot towards unconsciousness and the absence of any sounds of passenger activity in the aircraft. No human response of any kind was detected for the remainder of the flight. Five hours after taking off from Perth, the aircraft impacted the ground near Burketown, Queensland, and was destroyed. There were no survivors.The aircraft's flightpath was consistent with the aircraft being controlled by the autopilot with no human intervention after the aircraft passed position DEBRA. After the aircraft climbed above the assigned altitude of FL250, the speech and breathing patterns of the pilot displayed changes that were consistent with hypoxia, but a rapid or explosive aircraft cabin depressurisation was unlikely to have occurred.Testing revealed that Carbon Monoxide and Hydrogen Cyanide were highly unlikely to have been factors in the occurrence, and the absence of irritation in the airways of the occupants indicated that a fire in the cabin was also unlikely. The possibility of the pilot alone being incapacitated by a medical condition such as a stroke or heart attack would appear unlikely, given that there was no apparent activity or action by the other occupants of the aircraft for the duration of the flight.The investigation concluded that while there are several possible reasons for the pilot and passengers being incapacitated, the incapacitation was probably a result of hypobaric hypoxia due to the aircraft being fully or partially unpressurised and their not receiving supplemental oxygen. Due to the extensive nature of the damage to the aircraft caused by the impact with the ground, and because no recording systems were installed in the aircraft (nor were they required to be), the investigation could not determine the reason for the aircraft being unpressurised, or why the pilot and passengers did not receive supplemental oxygen."
1423,ACC1397,"The flight was chartered by a local engineering company to transport equipment to Kugluktuk and return with empty fuel barrels. On the return trip, the pilot was to overfly and inspect the abandoned airstrip at Port Radium on Great Bear Lake, from which he planned to operate in the next few days. The flight arrived in Kugluktuk at 13:18, unloaded the cargo, loaded empty fuel barrels, and refuelled. The flight departed Kugluktuk at 14:24 for Port Radium. Using GPS navigation the pilots flew to Port Radium and initiated a descent for the airstrip. The plane descended until it hit treetops. The wings were torn off the fuselage and the fuselage contacted up-sloping rocky terrain. The aircraft bounced and tumbled up the 12-degree slope and came to rest at the top of a steep slope of snow and ice, inverted."
1426,ACC1400,"At 05:43 hours in the morning the Corvette jet departed Málaga on a short flight to Córdoba where the crew were to pick up personnel for a medical (transplantation) flight. Weather at Córdoba was not very good with a horizontal visibility of 300 meters and 500 ft vertically. The airport did not have an ILS runway so the captain decided to carry out an approach using the on board GPS. During the approach to runway 21, the airplane collided with an electricity pole, contacted the ground, and hit an unoccupied building."
1430,ACC1404,"Curtiss C-46 N1419Z had delivered 2,000 gallons of fuel oil to Nondalton and was heading home to Kenai via Lake Clark Pass when the crew were forced to divert to a southern route to avoid poor weather. The wreckage was found the next day at 2,800 feet on a steep ridge line about 10 miles southeast of Redoubt Volcano. The same aircraft, N1419Z (also piloted by captain Munsoon) was involved in a fuel spill incident at Kenai, August 31, 2000. The C-46 Commando had just loaded 450 gallons of aviation fuel into its primary tank when Kenai Airport Fuel Service crews heard a loud popping noise and saw fuel leaking from the tank. The spill was quickly contained thanks to prompt action by the fueling crew, Everts Air employees and the fire services."
1431,ACC1405,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air, N30EM, impacted Beaver Mountain, south of the Rangeley Municipal Airport, Maine. The certificated commercial pilot and passenger were fatally injured. A mixture of night instrument meteorological and visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight that departed Portland, Maine, destined for Rangeley.When the airplane was 17 miles southwest of its destination, the pilot was cleared for an instrument approach. At 9 miles, the pilot reported the airport in sight, and cancelled his IFR clearance. The airplane continued to descend towards the airport on a modified left base until radar contact was lost at 3,300 feet msl. The pilot was in radio contact with his wife just prior to the accident. He advised her that he was on base for runway 32. Neither the pilot's wife, nor ATC received a distress call from the pilot. The airplane was located the next morning about 100 feet below the top of a mountain. The accident site was 7.9 miles from the airport, and approximately 1,200 feet above the airport elevation. Ground based weather radar recorded light snow showers, in the general vicinity of the accident site about the time of the accident, and satellite imagery showed that the airplane was operating under a solid overcast. A level path was cut through the trees that preceded the main wreckage. Examination of both engines and the airframe revealed no pre impact failures or malfunctions."
1432,ACC1406,"The aircraft, with the pilot and four passengers on board, departed Blackbushe from runway 08 in fog with a visibility of less than 500 metres. As the aircraft reached the upwind end of the runway it was seen to bank to the left before disappearing from view. It crashed 13 seconds later into a factory complex where a major fire ensued. All on board were fatally injured. A substantial amount of the aircraft structure was consumed by fire. Engineering examination of that which remained showed that there was no malfunction found within the engines, propellers or controls that would have affected the flight. Analysis of the cockpit voice recorder however showed a reduction in one of the propellers rpm as the aircraft rotated that would have led to thrust asymmetry. Through a combination of lack of visual reference, confusion as to the cause of the power reduction and possible disorientation the pilot lost control of the aircraft and although he may have realised the situation seconds before impact with the ground there was insufficient height available to effect a safe recovery."

Somewhere between 8 pm and 11 pm a fisherman spotted the wreckage of the plane at the 1,500 foot level on Table Top Mountain near Eider Point, AK. Weather was poor in the area with heavy snowfall.The aircraft's construction number probably is 13863, although the FAA lists the plane as 25309."
167,ACC141,"Shortly after takeoff from runway 24, the DC-3 appeared to enter a series of three stalls. The left wing dropped during these maneuvers. The aircraft then suddenly entered a spin to the right and crashed into the tidal flat. An explosion occurred and the aircraft caught fire."
1436,ACC1410,"The DC-3 was flying tourists back from Canaima to Porlamar and made a refueling stop at Ciudad Bolívar. Shortly after takeoff engine problems forced the pilot to return to Ciudad Bolívar. While trying to return, control was lost and the DC-3 crashed into the residential El Perú area, vía La piscina. The aircraft struck a large tree and burst into flames."

The aircraft departed El Yopal at 13:45. While attempting to land at Mitú, the landing gear struck the ground short of the threshold of runway 01. The crew carried out a go around and assessed the situation. The left hand main gear was broken away and a hydraulic leak caused control problems. By switching from the yellow to the blue hydraulic system, the crew were able to regain control.After flying over the control tower at Mitú, they were informed by the controller of the loss of the left main left gear. The flight crew then declared an emergency and informed the tower controller at Mitú that they would proceed to Bogotá. The crew was not able to fully raise the flaps, so a decision was made to divert to El Yopal/The plane climbed to 10000 feet and proceeded to El Yopal at this altitude. The crew then observed that the left engine oil pressure was dropping and the pilot proceeded to shut down the engine. In these conditions the plane began to lose height and speed. They then established contact with the control tower of El Yopal, informing the them of the emergency. It was decided to perform another flyby of the tower, which confirmed the left main hear had separated.The crew then agreed to burn fuel from the left wing tank to avoid a fire on that side during the emergency landing. The fuel indicators showed unreliable values and calculations were difficult since last part of the flight was performed under irregular circumstances. It was then decided to select the left fuel tank and continue to burn fuel until the low fuel warning appeared.The co-pilot recommended the captain to try to restart the left engine to have both reversers available on landing, but the request was rejected.Flying to the South-West of El Yopal Airport, the pilot ordered the co-pilot to move further away from the runway, while taking his cell phone to communicate with the Director of Operations of the airline. When the low fuel alarm went off, they selected the right tank, and the captain decided to return to land. During the approach the right engine began to fail. The plane lost height quickly until it impacted the ground 4.9 miles from the threshold of runway 05. The aircraft caught fire after the impact and was completely destroyed."

1450,ACC1424,"The Caravan was chartered to fly a party of eight to Estancia La Cristina. Among the passengers were the president of the Techint company and the managing editor of the La Nacion newspaper. The flight was planned to depart April 26, but was postponed to the 28th. The airplane was hangared ready to depart. The flight finally departed early in the morning from San Fernando's runway 24. Baires Control cleared the pilot to climb to FL60. After reaching that altitude the pilot requested permission to fly direct to the Padex waypoint and climb to FL 080. Permission was granted. At 04:54 the pilot requested another climb clearance for FL100 to get out of the clouds. This was allowed after conflicting traffic had crossed his path. Because icing conditions existed at that altitude, a further climb to FL120 was requested and obtained. The Cessna apparently lost control, spiralled down and crashed in rugged farm country."
1451,ACC1425,"The Cessna Caravan was carrying 11 skydivers and climbed to FL140. As the first team of four exited the aircraft, the middle parachutists reserve parachutes pilot chute deployed. Due to the bent over position of that parachutist, the action of the ejector spring in the pilot chute pushed the chute upwards and over the horizontal stabiliser of the aircraft, pulling the reserve canopy with it. The parachutist passed below the horizontal stabiliser resulting in the reserve parachute risers and lines tangling around the left elevator and horizontal stabiliser. Eleven seconds later, the empennage separated from the aircraft and the left elevator and the parachutist separated from the empennage. The aircraft then entered a steep, nose-down spiral descent. The pilot instructed the remaining parachutists to abandon the aircraft; the last one left the aircraft at an altitude of 9,000 feet. The pilot transmitted a mayday call, shutdown the engine and left his seat. On reaching the rear of the cabin, he found that the roller blind had closed, preventing him from leaving the aircraft. After several attempts, the pilot raised the blind sufficiently to allow him to exit the aircraft, and at an altitude of approximately 1,000 feet agl, he deployed his parachute and landed safely."
1454,ACC1428,"An Antonov 2 biplane was destroyed when it crashed on the banks of the Akhtuba River, Volgograd Region, Russia. All three on board were killed. The airplane was returning to the airport after parachutists had jumped from the plane. On board were the pilot, a parachutist instructor and a passenger. Probably sitting in the right seat the unfastened passenger slid off the chair and leaned on a control column. The plane went into a nosedive at an altitude of 1000 meters. It impacted the ground at a speed of 310 km/h."
1457,ACC1431,"The Ilyushin was operating on a cargo flight from Chkalovsky to Taiyuan, China. Intermediate stops were planned at Noril'sk and Bratsk. Weather at Chkalovsky included fog with a visibility of 500-900 m, vertical visibility 70-80 m, temperature +8deg C. The aircraft was prepared for departure and, according to the loading documents, loaded with 40,2 tons of cargo. The takeoff weight would thus be 191,9 tons. However, the cargo was not properly weighed and the actual takeoff weight was approximately 204 tons, which exceeded the maximum permissible weight by 14 tons. Flaps were set at 30°, slats to 14°, and the stabilizer was at 5,4° airplane nose up. After accelerating down the runway, the captain started to rotate at a speed of 250 km/h (135 kts), lifting off at a speed of 290 km/h (157 kts) after a takeoff run of 2700 m. The undercarriage was raised and at the height of approximately 10  meters, the captain carried out a right-hand turn with a 7 deg bank to compensate for a slight deviation to the left during takeoff. At a height of about 23 m the stabilizer was trimmed from -5,4° to -3,9° without using elevator to compensate. The Ilyushin then descended to about 20 m before it contacted trees, 930 m past the end of the runway. The no. 3 and 4 engines were destroyed by the impact and the airplane descended further until contacting terrain at 1460 m past the end of the runway.The investigation into the cause of the accident revealed a large number of problems in the operations and maintenance of the Russ Air Transport Company, the Atruvera company and also in the flight service organization of Chkalovsky Airport."

Intermediate stops were planned at Copenhagen (Denmark), Keflavik (Iceland), Narsarsuaq (Greenland) and Sept-Îles (Canada). The flight was uneventful until the approach to Narsarsuaq. The crew made a briefing on the runway 07 NDB/DME approach while descending to FL195. At 04:27 UTC, while descending through FL130, Narsarsuaq cleared the crew for an approach at their own discretion. Weather at the time was: wind 080deg at 24 knots, visibility 10 km with broken clouds at 6000 feet and overcast at 9000 feet, light rain.While flying the approach, the crew did not adhere to the Standard Operating Procedures a.o. with regards to altitude calls and checklist reading. Furthermore the GPWS was inoperative and the crew were exposed to peak fatigue. They were awake for 22 hours and were on duty for 16:56 hours. Flight duty time was exceeded by almost three hours. While attempting a visual approach to runway 07 the aircraft descended into a high ground to the left of the runway 07 approach path and broke up."
1461,ACC1435,"The aircraft departed Bukavu for a flight to Kampene. An intermediate stop was made at Kama, where some cargo was loaded and passengers boarded the plane. Eight minutes after takeoff from Kama, one of the engines failed. The crew, consisting of two Russian pilots, elected to divert to Bukavu but the aircraft crashed 10 km short. According to survivors the aircraft was overloaded with a.o. arms and ammunition."
1463,ACC1437,"Binter flight 8261 left Melilla 37 minutes late, at 9:37, for a flight to Málaga. The climb and cruise were uneventful and at 10:03 the co-pilot contacted Malaga Approach. The flight was cleared for a runway 32 ILS approach. After switching from the Approach to the Tower radio frequency, a no. 1 engine fire warning was noted by the crew. The co-pilot advised Malaga Tower of the emergency ""estamos en corta final, llevamos fuego en un motor, declaramos emergencia"". The co-pilot followed the emergency procedures, during which both engines were switched off. The plane descended and collided with the post of the first approach lights, 538 meters short of the runway threshold. It slid 220 meters, during which it hit five approach light stanchion and finally hit the embankment of the N-340 motorway. Following the crash, some passengers remained trapped in the aircraft for 10 minutes until its rear door could be opened."
1464,ACC1438,"Flight 93 departed New York-Newark (EWR) for San Francisco (SFO) at 08:47. The aircraft was hijacked by four terrorists. The hijackers took over control, reportedly switched off the transponder and changed course to, probably, Washington. At 09:35, near Cleveland, the aircraft changed course to the South and later (09:45) Southwest at FL350. At 10:03 the aircraft crashed out of control in a field near Somerset, PA. The hijackers possibly had the intention to crash the plane into Air Force One, Camp David or perhaps Washington. The aircraft crashed following passengers attempt to take down the hijackers."
1465,ACC1439,"The Let L-410UVP-E as cleared for takeoff from runway 28 at Chichén Itzá Airport, Mexico. The aircraft used 2100 meters of the 2800 m long runway.

The aircraft impacted terrain, killing all aboard."
1469,ACC1443,"On the night of October 10 the first major winter weather of the season passed through the Dillingham area. Temperatures dropped steadily to about -4deg C. Caravan N9530F had been parked outside and was subjected to rain, snow, causing ice accumulation. Because of these conditions, ramp personnel de-iced the airplane with a heated mixture of glycol and water. The flight departed and climbed to about 650 feet (200 m) msl when the airplane suddenly pitched up, rolled 90 degrees to the left, and yawed to the left. The airplane then descended nose-down until crashing in a level attitude and a flight path angle of about 40 degrees down."
1471,ACC1445,Perimeter Flight 962 had departed God's Lake Narrows for a short 27 minute medevac flight to Shamattawa to pick up a patient. The crew were flying a night time approach to runway 01 when they carried out a missed approach because they were too high and too fast. The aircraft flew into trees slightly to the left of the runway centreline in a muskeg area about 2600 feet from the departure end of runway 01. A post-crash fire was confined to the wings which had separated from the cabin and cockpit wreckage.

1482,ACC1456,"A Beechcraft B200C Super King Air, registered VH-FMN, departed Adelaide Airport, SA (ADL) at 22:40 hours under the Instrument Flight Rules for Mount Gambier Airport, SA (MGB). The ambulance aircraft was being positioned from Adelaide to Mount Gambier to transport a patient from Mount Gambier to Sydney for a medical procedure, for which time constraints applied. The pilot intended to refuel the aircraft at Mount Gambier. The planned flight time to Mount Gambier was 52 minutes. On board were the pilot and one medical crewmember. The medical crewmember was seated in a rear-facing seat behind the pilot.On departure from Adelaide, the pilot climbed the aircraft to an altitude of 21,000 ft above mean sea level for the flight to Mount Gambier. At approximately 23:08, the pilot requested and received from Air Traffic Services (ATS) the latest weather report for Mount Gambier aerodrome, including the altimeter sub-scale pressure reading of 1012 millibars. At approximately 23:12, the pilot commenced descent to Mount Gambier. At approximately 23:24, the aircraft descended through about 8,200 ft and below ATS radar coverage.At approximately 23:26, the pilot made a radio transmission on the Mount Gambier Mandatory Broadcast Zone (MBZ) frequency advising that the aircraft was 26 NM north, inbound, had left 5,000 ft on descent and was estimating the Mount Gambier circuit at 23:35. At about 23:27, the pilot started a series of radio transmissions to activate the Mount Gambier aerodrome pilot activated lighting (PAL). At approximately 23:29, the pilot made a radio transmission advising that the aircraft was 19 NM north and maintaining 4,000 ft. About 3 minutes later, he made another series of transmissions to activate the Mount Gambier PAL. At approximately 23:33, the pilot reported to ATS that he was in the circuit at Mount Gambier and would report after landing. Witnesses located in the vicinity of the aircraft's flight path reported that the aircraft was flying lower than normal for aircraft arriving from the northwest.At approximately 23:36 (56 minutes after departure), the aircraft impacted the ground at a position 3.1 NM from the threshold of runway 18. The pilot sustained fatal injuries and the medical crewmember sustained serious injuries, but egressed unaided."

The aircraft crashed 40 km east of Bunia; it may have been shot down by Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels, fighting the Uganda government. Poor weather is also rumored to have played a role in the accident."
1484,ACC1458,"The flight from Bremerhaven to Wangerooge was planned to depart at 09:30, but was delayed by over half an hour. At that moment a snow shower passed the airport and snowfall continued for 15 minutes. The pilot then prepared the plane for departure. He wiped some snow off the cockpit windows and leading edge of the wings with his hands. At 10:08 the engines were started and the airplane taxied to runway 34 for departure. The aircraft climbed slowly to a height of 195 feet and set course over the Weser River. It then lost height and crashed into the water."
1485,ACC1459,"Challenger N90AG was prepared for a flight from Birmingham, UK to Bangor. The flight was cleared to taxi at 12:01 hrs. The captain was pilot-non-flying and was seated in the right cockpit seat. During taxi, the crew completed their normal Before Takeoff Checks; these included confirmation that the control checks had been completed and that anti-ice might be required immediately after takeoff. Flap 20 had been selected for takeoff and the following speeds had been calculated and briefed by the pilots: V1 137 kt; VR 140 kt; V2 147 kt. By 12:06, the aircraft was cleared to line up on runway 15. At 12:07 hrs, N90AG was cleared for takeoff with a surface wind of 140°/8 kt. Takeoff appeared normal up to lift-off. Rotation was started at about 146 kt. Lift-off occurred 2 seconds later, at about 153 kt and with a pitch attitude of about 8 degrees nose-up. Immediately after lift-off, the aircraft started to bank to the left. The rate of bank increased rapidly and 2 seconds after lift-off the bank angle had reached 50 degrees. At that point, the aircraft heading had diverged about 10 degrees to the left. Opposite aileron, followed closely by right rudder, was applied as the aircraft started banking; full right aileron and full right rudder had been applied within 1 second and were maintained. As the bank angle continued to increase, progressively more aircraft nose-up elevator was applied. Stick-shaker operation initiated 3.5 seconds after lift-off. The left winglet contacted the runway shoulder, the outboard part of the left wing detached and the aircraft struck the ground inverted, structurally separating the forward fuselage. Fuel released from ruptured tanks ignited and the wreckage slid to a halt on fire. The last recorded aircraft attitude was approximately 111 degrees left bank and 13 degrees nose-down pitch."

1520,ACC1494,"Flight 359 departed Khabarovsk on a passenger flight to Ayan with an intermediate stop at Polina Osipenko. Weather at the destination was reported fine as the crew decided to takeoff from Polina Osipenko. However, weather quickly worsened. The controllers which were in contact with the flight did not have this information, so the crew were unaware of inclement weather in the Ayan area. After contacting the Ayan approach controller the crew were told that the visibility was 5000 metres but that the fog was closing in rapidly. Important meteorological information (cloud base, visibility, RVR) was not available at that moment and thus not relayed to the crew as they were conducting their initial approach. The Antonov descended at an average vertical rate of descent of about 7 m/s. It reached an altitude of 800 metres at a point were it should have been at 950 metres. The crew then made a premature turn to finals. Starting at an altitude of 660 metres (instead of 950) the aircraft during the turn entered into stratus clouds, passing into the fog with the horizontal visibility approximately 50 m. It descended to 320 metres on completion of the turn, having deviated 2,3 km to the right of the extended runway centreline. Instead of aborting the approach, the captain decided to continue. At a height of 188 metres the aircraft collided with the slope of a mountain with a height of 226,4 m.The aircraft was attempting its second approach in fog when it struck a cliff 10 meters below the top at a distance of 4.8 km from the runway, ripping off one wing and the undercarriage. The fuselage and the other wing continued for about 100 meters and crashed in the valley 85 meters below."

1538,ACC1512,"The Let 410 was involved in skydiving flights out of Borki aerodrome. The aircraft in question was owned by Mr Yu. M Kabanov, deputy director of the Aviation Complex Myachkovo (AKM) and used by the Borki Air Club. On the day of the accident 23 skydivers boarded the Let 410. This was illegal since the maximum number of skydivers allowed on a Let 410 is 12 with lateral seating. In this case nearly all skydivers were sitting on the airplane's floor, one even occupied the toilet. As a result the airplane was overloaded by 618 kg and the centre of gravity was probably about 32% MAC where the maximum rear CofG was 28% MAC. At an altitude of about 3900 metres eleven skydivers prepared to exit the plane. When four of them had gotten out the CofG moved further aft (probably to about 35%) causing the Let to pitch up. The plane stalled, fell to the left and descended out of control. At an altitude of 2000 metres the aft fuselage section failed. Several skydivers were thrown out and the airplane crashed in a field."

The instrument rated private pilot and his 2 passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was owned and operated by the pilot. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed for the personal flight for which a visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan was filed. The flight originated from Tulum at 17:30 with Chetumal (CTM) as its intended destination.Local authorities reported the airplane had been cleared to land on runway 10 at the Chetumal International Airport. Witnesses reported that the airplane rolled and nosed over during the turn from left base to final approach. The airplane came to rest about 4 miles from the threshold of runway 10. A post-impact fire consumed the airframe."
1547,ACC1521,"N138BF was the first of two conforming prototypes of the SJ30-2 business jet. The aircraft departed San Antonio for flight test number 231 for flight flutter certification. The first flutter mission, flight test number 230, was flown one day earlier with the same pilot onboard. The pilot terminated the flight after an uncommanded roll to the left, and a subsequent discrepancy was noticed between his displayed airspeeds and those reported by a chase plane pilot. After takeoff, the airplane climbed to 39,000 feet and set up for a shallow dive along a 090-degree track. This time no problems were noted. The airplane subsequently turned back to the west and began to climb back to 39,000 feet to set up for another dive to the flight test point along a 270-degree magnetic track. This run also was uneventful. The pilot was then cleared to the next test point. However, the pilot did not acknowledge the clearance, but instead, reported that the airplane was rolling to the right, and he couldn't stop it. About 30,000 feet, the test airplane began rolling to the right. The rolling maneuver appeared to be stable, and continued unchanged until ground impact. The airplane rolled about 7 times during a 49-second timeframe, from about 30,500 feet until a near-vertical ground impact.Although the manufacturers engineering analysis (which did not include any high-speed wind tunnel testing) had predicted positive lateral stability up to Mach 0.90, lateral control was lost during the accident flight below that speed. After the accident, the company conducted high-speed wind tunnel tests, and found that lateral stability decreased with increasing Mach and angle of attack (AOA). Lateral stability became negative (unstable) above Mach 0.83, and rudder input intended to augment lateral trim above a certain Mach could aggravate the situation."

1557,ACC1531,"Several small forest fires had erupted near Cranbrook and the Air Spray Electra Tanker 86 was called in to fight the fires. Accompanied by a Turbo Commander the Electra took off from Cranbrook at 12:10. The Turbo Commander assessed the appropriate aircraft flight path profiles and established the most suitable fire-retardant delivery program for the ground fire. Following the flight path demonstrations by the Turbo Commander aircraft, Tanker 86 proceeded to carry out the retardant drop on the fire. After delivering the specified retardant load, Tanker 86 was seen to turn right initially then entered a turn to the left. In a left angle of bank of about 70 degrees and nose-low the Electra then struck the terrain on the side of a steep ridge at about 3900 feet above sea level. The aircraft exploded on impact."
1559,ACC1533,"The Citation carried out a visual approach to the Sorocaba Airport. After landing the crew lost control of the aircraft. It overran the runway, went down a drop off and skidded into a street in the Vila Helena quarter. The airplane collided with four houses and three vehicles and ended up in a small field. The crash site elevation was 25 meters lower than the runway elevation."

Preliminary radar information revealed a ground speed of 190 knots over the approach end of runway 13, where the Vref landing speed should have been 116 knots. Eyewitnesses reported that the plane touched down past the intersection for taxiway Charlie, which is located about 1,875-feet short of the departure end of the runway. Breaking action started 630 feet further on. Apparently the aircraft could not be brought to a halt and overran the runway end. The jet plunged off the south end of the runway, crossed Johnson Boulevard and plowed into the Masonic Cemetery where it burst into flames, approximately 1,600 feet beyond the departure end of the runway."
1567,ACC1541,"The fire tanker airplane, Air Tanker 99, was on a cross-country positioning flight and collided with mountainous terrain while maneuvering in a canyon near the destination airport. Witnesses who held pilot certificates were on a mountain top at 7,900 feet and saw a cloud layer as far to the south as they could see. They used visual cues to estimate that the cloud tops were around 5,000 feet mean sea level (msl).  They noted that the clouds did not extend all the way up into the mountain canyons; the clouds broke up near the head of some canyons.  When they first saw the airplane, they assumed that it came from above the clouds.  It was proceeding north up a canyon near the edge of clouds, which were breaking up.  They were definitely looking down at the airplane the whole time.  They saw the airplane make a 180-degree turn that was steeper than a standard rate turn.  The wings leveled and the airplane went through one cloud, reappeared briefly, and then entered the cloud layer.  It appeared to be descending when they last saw it.  About 2 minutes later, they saw the top of the cloud layer bulge and turn a darker color.  The bulge began to subside and they observed several smaller bulges appear.  They notified local authorities that they thought a plane was down.  Searchers discovered the wreckage at that location and reported that the wreckage and surrounding vegetation were on fire.  The initial responders reported that the area was cloudy and the visibility was low.  Examination of the ground scars and wreckage debris path disclosed that the airplane collided with the canyon walls in controlled flight on a westerly heading of 260 degrees at an elevation of 3,400 feet msl.  The operator had an Automated Flight Following (AFF) system installed on the airplane.  It recorded the airplane's location every 2 minutes using a GPS.  The data indicated that the airplane departed Prescott and flew direct to the Twentynine Palms VORTAC (very high frequency omni-directional radio range, tactical air navigation).  The flight changed course slightly to 260 degrees, which took it to the northeast corner of the wilderness area where the accident occurred.  At 11:02, the data indicated that the airplane was at 11,135 feet msl at 204 knots.  The airplane then made three left descending 360-degree turns. The third turn began at 6,010 feet msl. At 11:16:57, the last recorded data point indicated that the airplane was at an altitude of 3,809 feet heading 256 degrees at a speed of 128 knots."
1568,ACC1542,"Convair 580 ZK-KFU was scheduled for 2 regular return night freight flights from Christchurch to Palmerston North. At 20:32 flight 642 started its takeoff from runway 20 on schedule and climbed to FL210. The flight progressed normally. At 21:13 the Wellington controller cleared the flight to descend initially to FL130 and later to FL110. After contacting Ohakea Control the crew were further cleared down to 7000 feet and were given vectors for the approach to Palmerston. The aircraft descended through an area of forecast severe icing, which was probably beyond the capabilities of the aircraft anti-icing system to prevent ice build-up on the wings and tailplane. The aircraft then probably stalled because of a rapid build-up of ice, pitching the aircraft nose down and probably disorientating the crew. Airspeed increased to 392 kts and the G loading was peaking at 3.21 G. The angle of bank was probably between 50° and 60°. Increasing torsional stress on the wing roots probably caused panels to buckle and separate. At an altitude of 6800 feet the wings and engines started to separate. Nine seconds later the remaining fuselage impacted the sea about vertically and at high speed."
1575,ACC1549,"The aircraft flew into inclement weather and slammed into a hill covered by dense trees about two miles from an airstrip in Maconacon town, Isabela."
1576,ACC1550,"The McDonnell Douglas DC-9-15F, operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Bogotá to Mitú, Colombia, with a refueling stop at El Yopal. After an uneventful flight the aircraft landed at El Yopal at 15:51 hours local time. Refueling took place and the aircraft departed for Mitú at 16:40 hours. The aircraft climbed to the en route altitude of FL290. Bogotá Control then cleared the flight to descend to FL180 and requested to the crew to contact Mitú Tower. At 17:08 hours the flight crew radioed Mitú Tower, stating they were descending through FL250 at 80 miles from Mitú. The tower controller then cleared the flight to the traffic pattern altitude of 7000 feet and to expect runway 01 for arrival.Less than a minute later, at FL233, the flight crew heard a sudden loud noise, followed by another loud noise. The aircraft then entered an uncontrolled descent until it impacted terrain, killing all three occupants.The wreckage was found on December 28."
1579,ACC1553,"Union des Transports Africains de Guinée operated two flights a week from Conakry, Guinea to Beirut and Dubai with their newly acquired ex-American Airlines Boeing 727. On December 25, UTA Flight 141 departed Conakry, Guinea for a scheduled flight to Beirut, Lebanon with a planned intermediate stop at Cotonou, Benin and a planned technical stop at Kufrah, Libya. The flight departed at 10:07 carrying 86 passengers and a crew of 10. It arrived at Cotonou at 12:25 were nine passengers disembarked. A total of 63 persons checked in at the airport check-in desk. Ten others boarded from an aircraft that had arrived from Lomé, Togo. Passenger boarding and baggage loading took place in a climate of great confusion. The airplane was full and it is thought that there were more passengers aboard the plane than had officially checked in. In the cockpit, two UTA executives were occupying the jump seats. Faced with the particularly large number and size of the hand baggage, the chief flight attendant informed the captain of the situation. Meanwhile the ground handling companys agents began loading the baggage in the aft hold when one of the operators agents asked them to continue loading in the forward hold, which already contained baggage. When the operation was finished, the hold was full. During this time, the crew prepared the airplane for the second flight segment. The co-pilot was discussing his concerns with the UTA executives, reminding them of the importance of determining the precise weight of the loading of the airplane. The captain determined the limitations for the flight and selected the following configuration: flaps 25°, air conditioning units shut down.At 13:47, the crew began the pre-flight checklist. Calm was restored in the cockpit. At 13:52, they were cleared to roll. The co-pilot was pilot flying (PF). The elevator was set at 6 3/4, it was stated that the takeoff would be performed with full power applied with brakes on, followed by a climb at three degrees maximum to gain speed, with no turn after landing gear retraction. As the roll was beginning, a flight attendant informed the cockpit that passengers who wanted to sit near their friends were still standing and did not want to sit down. The airlines Director General called the people in the cabin to order.It was warm outside at a temperature of 32 deg. C with a light breeze as the flight received permission to takeoff from runway 24. Runway 06/24 is an asphalt runway, measuring 2400 (7874 feet) meters with a 55 m (180 feet) overrun zone. At 13:58:01 the thrust levers were advanced. Fourteen seconds later the brakes were released and the 727 accelerated down the runway. Forty-six seconds after brake release the captain announced V1 and VR speeds. At that moment the aircraft was 1620 m down the runway at a speed of 137 kts. The copilot tried to rotate the plane, but seven seconds later, at a speed of 148 kts and 2100 m down the runway, the nose just slowly rose. The 727 barely climbed, causing the main undercarriage to strike localizer antennas. It then struck the roof of a 2-3 meters high small building housing radio equipment. The operator inside the building suffered injuries. The plane continued, smashed through the concrete airport boundary fence, crashed and broke up on the shoreline. The exact number of occupants and fatalities could not be established with certainty. It is thought that 133 passengers died in the crash with an additional three people of which it was not possible to establish if they were passengers or passers-by on the beach. Most probably however, they were passengers."
1583,ACC1557,"Uzbekistan Airways' flight HY1154, the evening flight from Termez to Tashkent, departed Termez with a crew of five and an almost full load (32) of passengers. Weather was poor as the flight approached the airport. After reporting capturing the glideslope the air traffic controller reported a vertical visibility of 60 m and a runway visual range of 1300 m. About 12,5 km out, the aircraft's rate of descent increased, causing it to descend below the glideslope. The rate of descent was arrested at a height of 170 m, 8 km from the threshold of runway 08L and they continued in level flight. At the Outer Marker (3,5 km from the runway) they should have started their initial approach, but the crew continued level flight thus flying above the glideslope now. With 2,5 km to go the airplane descended slightly at 1-1,5 m/sec. At the Inner Marker the descent rate increased to 2-2,6 m/sec. The crew then probably saw the runway lights below them. The engines were brought back to idle and reverse thrust was applied at a height of 60 m. When it appeared that they would not be able to land given the remaining runway length, reverse thrust was deselected and engine power was increased. At that point the airplane touched down 260 m past the end of the runway. It continued until the right wing struck a concrete building. The plane then lost the left wing before it crashed through a concrete wall. The airplane broke up, crashed into a ditch and caught fire."
1584,ACC1558,"At 15:23 Cessna Caravan C-FAGA was fueled at Windsor Airport, ON (YQG) in preparation for flight GGN125 to Pelee Island, ON. At 15:55, the aircraft was de-iced and departed ten minutes later. The aircraft landed at 16:20. While on the ramp, two individuals voiced concern to the pilot that there was ice on the wing. Freezing precipitation was falling. The pilot was observed to visually check the leading edge of the wing; however, he did not voice any concern and proceeded with loading the passengers and cargo. At approximately 16:38, flight GGN126 departed Pelee Island for Windsor. After using most of the runway length for takeoff, the aircraft climbed out at a very shallow angle. The pilot raised the flaps while over Lake Erie. The Caravan then entered an aerodynamic stall. Because the plane was rolling into a climbing right turn, the left wing stalled first. The nose dropped and the airplane rolled to the left. The airplane was too low for recovery and struck the ice.It was determined that the aircraft was overweight by 1270 pounds (576 kg) when it departed Pelee Island. The maximum takeoff weight for this flight was 8550 pounds (3878 kg)."
1587,ACC1561,"A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Kish Air, was destroyed when it crashed near Sharjah Airport (SHJ), United Arab Emirates. All six crew members and 37 of the 40 passengers were killed.The aircraft was operating as a scheduled flight from Kish Island, Iran to Sharjah, UAE with the captain initially as the pilot flying (PF). During the cruise and just prior to descent, the captain unexpectedly handed over control of the aircraft to the First Officer prior to the approach to Sharjah. The first officer did not accept this willingly and stated that he was not confident of his ability to conduct a VOR/DME approach into Sharjah. This statement was not consistent with his previous experience and could indicate either a cultural or professional issue. The captain insisted the first officer fly the aircraft and encouraged and instructed him during the approach. At 11:24 hours local time, the aircraft contacted Dubai Arrivals and was cleared from 9000 ft to 5000 ft and instructed to expect a VOR/DME approach to runway 12 at Sharjah International Airport. At 11:29 hours the aircraft was further cleared to 2500 ft and cleared for the approach. The aircraft was under its own navigation and the daylight conditions were fine with excellent visibility. At 11:35 hours the aircraft was instructed to contact Sharjah Tower and the pilot reported that the aircraft was established on the VOR final approach for runway 12. The Tower cleared IRK7170 to land and advised that the wind was calm. At that point the aircraft was slightly above the approach profile. The initial speed for the approach was at least 50 kt high at approximately 190 kt with no flap and no landing gear. The aircraft should have been configured with landing gear down and flap 10° during the approach and stabilized at 130 kt prior to the MDA. Approaching the MDA at flight idle setting, the auto-pilot was disengaged and the first Officer called for flap 10 at 186 kt (limiting speed of 180 kt) and flap 25 was selected by the Captain, a setting uncalled for by the Pilot Flying at 183 kt (limiting speed of 160 kt), and the landing gear was called for and selected at approximately 185 kt (limiting speed of 170 kt). The captain then took control of the aircraft and shortly afterwards the ground range selectors were heard by Cockpit Voice Recorder to be lifted and the power levers moved from the flight idle stop into the ground control range. The left propeller then went to full reverse whilst the right propeller remained in positive pitch within the ground control range. The aircraft descended in an extreme nose low left bank attitude until impact. The aircraft crashed 2.6 nm from the runway onto an unprepared sandy area adjacent to a road and residential buildings. The aircraft broke apart on impact and a fire started immediately."

1596,ACC1570,"The twin-engined Let plane was chartered from Kush Air by Sudanese Women in Development and Peace to deliver relief supplies to a school project in Ayod. The plane was flown by two pilots from New Zealand. According to the owner of the plane cargo shifted after takeoff, causing the centre of gravity to shift to a point where the plane stalled and crashed.A senior aid official in Sudan confirmed that six people died and four survived the accident, despite earlier reports of as many as 12 or 14 dead.Earlier reports quoted that 9XR-DC was the plane involved, while later reports spoke about 9XR-EF.Initial news reports named the airline ""Air Cush"", likely meaning the Kush Air airline from South Sudan."
1598,ACC1572,"The Antonov 12 transport plane operated on several round trips between Juba and El Obeid since May 9, 2004. Each time 9018 kgs of fuel was uplifted in El Obeid while the average fuel consumption for a round trip was 10000 kgs.On the second round trip on May 11, on the leg back to El Obeid, 4201 kgs of fuel remained. The flight departed at 11:40 UTC and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL240.En route all four engines flamed out as a result of a lack of fuel. The propellers were feathered and the aircraft was prepared for a forced landing.The aircraft hit the ground with its nose first and bounced for 15 meters until it collided with trees. Due to high impact force and high rate of descent the wings were twisted. The cockpit section was compressed within the central cargo compartment and a small fire erupted, likely due to electrical shortage within the electrical equipment.There were no survivors.The crew was composed of an Armenian captain and ground engineer, a Sudanese first officer, a Sudanese navigator, a Sudanese radio operator, an Iraqi navigator and an Iraqi flight engineer.The investigation showed that the Sudanese navigator license was expired since July 2001. The Iraqi crew members did not have any valid licenses and their experience on the An-12 dated back from 1994.The aircraft's Certificate of Release to Service and Certificate of Maintenance Review both expired on April 30, 2004."
1602,ACC1576,Gabon Express flight 221 departed Libreville at 09:11 for a domestic flight to Franceville. It is reported that a loss of oil pressure in the no. 2 engine forced the crew to shut down the engine. They decided to return to the airport. On the approach the undercarriage would not extend because of problems with the hydraulics. The HS-748 overflew the runway and the pilot ditched the plane some 100 m offshore.
1608,ACC1582,"The Convair, owned by Air Tahoma, was carrying overnight delivery packages under contract to DHL Worldwide Express. The captain began fuel crossfeed operations about 50 minutes into the flight and allowed it to continue unmonitored for almost 30 minutes. During the crossfeed operations, the fuel tank shutoff valve had been left open. This is contrary to approved procedures and allowed fuel transfer from the left tank to the right tank. During the airplane's descent tolanding, the fuel in the left tank, which was providing fuel to both engines, was exhausted because both engine-driven fuel pumps drew air from the left tank into the fuel system instead of fuel from the right tank, which led to a dual engine flameout caused by fuel starvation. The airplane was approaching runway 36R at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport but did not make it to the runway. The aircraft crashed on the sixth hole at the World of Sports golf course, just south of the airport and broke up."

1610,ACC1584,"DHC-3 N197TT was one of two aircraft that departed McGrath for Unalakleet and Kotzebue to transport hunting camp supplies. Instrument meteorological conditions consisting of mist, fog, and smoke, prevailed in the area of the accident. Because of this, the Otter flew about 500 to 1,000 feet above the ground. Suddenly a mountain ridge appeared in front of the airplane. The pilot banked the airplane to the left, and added engine power. A few seconds later the airplane touched trees and descended into the ground, coming to rest upright. The survivors spent two nights at the wreckage under heavy forest fire smoke and severe weather before they were spotted by rescue crews."
1619,ACC1593,"The Antonov, piloted by four Russian crew members, reportedly left El Obeid around 11:35 for a flight to Juba. En route at FL170 the airplane is understood to have suffered engine problems. The crew decided to divert to Heglig. The aircraft crashed inverted in a wooded area, killing all aboard."
1620,ACC1594,"At 00:03 local time MK Airlines flight 1602 departed Windsor Locks-Bradley International Airport (BDL) for a flight to Zaragoza, Spain with a cargo of lawn tractors. An intermediate stop was made at Halifax (YHZ), where the aircraft landed at 02:12 local time. At YHZ the aircraft was loaded with 53,000 kilograms of lobster and fish. After fueling, the total fuel load was 89 400 kg. The planned takeoff weight was 353 000 kg. The Boeing Laptop Tool (BLT) was then used to calculate the takeoff speeds. Since the software was last used before the takeoff from Bradley, it still contained those figures. The airport information and weather was changed to Halifax, but somehow the takeoff weight was not changed and remained showing 240.000 kg. Takeoff performance data were generated, resulting in incorrect V speeds and thrust setting being transcribed to the takeoff data card. It is most likely that the crew did not adhere to the operator's procedures for an independent check of the takeoff data card, so the erroneous figures went unnoticed.It was dark, but the weather was fine as the airplane was cleared to taxi to runway 24 (8800 ft / 2682 m long) for departure. After push back, the aircraft began to taxi, the flaps were extended to 20°, and the horizontal stabilizer was set to 6.1 trim units, where it remained for the duration of the flight. The flight control checks were completed during the taxi. The aircraft entered runway 24 at Taxiway Delta and backtracked to the threshold. The aircraft then made a 180° turn to the right and, upon lining up with the runway, the thrust levers were advanced and a rolling takeoff was commenced at 06:53:22.At the start of the takeoff roll, the thrust levers were smoothly advanced from ground idle thrust (approximately 1.0 EPR) to takeoff power with all final EPR settings indicating between 1.3 and 1.33. The aircraft accelerated through 80 KCAS (06:53:46) approximately 1800 feet (550 m) from the threshold.At 130 KCAS, the control column was moved aft to 8.4° to initiate rotation as the aircraft passed the 5500-foot (1680 m) mark of runway 24 (3300 feet / 1010 m of runway remaining). The aircraft began to rotate. The pitch attitude stabilized briefly at approximately 9° nose-up, with airspeed at 144 KCAS. Because the 747 still had not lifted off the runway, the control column was moved further aft to 10°, and the aircraft responded with a further pitch up to approximately 11°; initial contact of the lower aft fuselage with the runway occurred at this time. The aircraft was approximately at the 8000-foot (2450 m) mark and slightly left of the centreline. The control column was then relaxed slightly, to 9° aft. The pitch attitude stabilized in the 11° range for the next four seconds, and the lower aft fuselage contact with the runway ended briefly. With approximately 600 feet (185 m) of runway remaining, the thrust levers were advanced to 92 per cent and the EPRs increased to 1.60. With 420 feet (130 m) remaining, the lower aft fuselage contacted the runway a second time. As the aircraft passed the end of the runway, the control column was 13.5° aft, pitch attitude was 11.9° nose-up, and airspeed was 152 KCAS. The highest recorded nose-up pitch of 14.5° (06:54:24) was recorded after the aircraft passed the end of the runway at a speed of 155 KCAS. The aircraft became airborne approximately 670 feet (205 m) beyond the paved surface and flew a distance of 325 feet (100 m). The lower aft fuselage then struck an earthen berm supporting an instrument landing system (ILS) localizer antenna. The aircraft's tail separated on impact, and the rest of the aircraft continued in the air for another 1200 feet (370 m) before it struck terrain and burst into flames."

1633,ACC1607,"The AirNow flight departed Bangor at 20:18 on a flight to Manchester. Weather at Manchester however was foggy and the pilot was unable to land there. The pilot then requested to proceed to his alternate destination, Burlington. During the flight to Burlington, the pilot was contacted by company dispatch and it was agreed that Bennington would be a better destination because it was 45 miles closer than Burlington. As the flight progressed towards Bennington, the pilot contacted ATC and requested to change his destination to Keene. Weather at Keene included winds from 350 degrees at 3 knots; 1 statute mile of visibility; an overcast cloud layer at 100 feet agl. The Bandeirante flew an ILS approach to runway 02. When the airplane broke out of the clouds, it was not stable. Approaching the runway, at full flaps and exceeding the 25 percent maximum for a go-around, the pilot added full power to the left engine. The high power setting, slow airspeed, and full flaps combination resulted in a minimum control speed (Vmc) roll. No determination could be made as to why the right engine was inoperative, and there were no mechanical or fuel-related anomalies found that would have precluded normal operation. The airplane came to rest inverted on runway 02, about 90 feet from the approach end."

About 13:50, the crew contacted Approach Control for initial descent clearance and was cleared down to FL160. The aircraft continued its descent until about 14:00 hours when the crew asked Approach Control whether it was raining to which the controller reported negative rain but scattered CB and the crew acknowledged.At 14:04, the crew reported established on the glide slope and the localizer at 8 nautical miles to touch down. Then the Approach controller informed the aircraft of precipitation approaching the airport from the direction of runway 21 and passed the aircraft to the Tower controller for landing instructions.The flight contacted Port Harcourt Tower and reported established on glide slope and localizer at 6 nautical miles to touch down. The controller then cleared the airplane to land on runway 21 but to exercise caution as the runway surface was slightly wet and the pilot acknowledged. On final approach, the flight encountered adverse weather with wind speed and direction changing from 220 deg/09 kts to 360 deg/05 kts.

During the descent the airplane collided with trees and subsequently the mountainous terrain on a heading of approximately 127 degrees and about 6,900 feet mean sea level. The initial impact point was located approximately nine nautical miles on a magnetic bearing of 130 degrees from the IAF. Documentation of the horizontal situation indicator (HSI) on the left side instrument panel indicated that the course arrow was positioned to approximately 127 degrees, the inbound heading to the IAF. The co-pilot (right side) course arrow was positioned to 115 degrees. The location of the wreckage and the 127 degree heading on the HSI indicate that the pilots failed to follow the approach procedure and turn to a heading of 097 degrees after crossing the IAF.Search crews found the wreckage of the plane on March 20."
1681,ACC1655,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, registered, HC-BXD, was destroyed when it crashed into a building shortly after takeoff from Cuenca-Mariscal Lamar Airport (CUE). The airplane had arrived at Cuenca at 10:18 after an uneventful flight from Macas (XMS). The Cessna 208B was prepared for the return flight to Macas and twelve passengers boarded the flight with 240 lb (109 kg) of baggage. Startup was approved at 10:57 and the airplane taxied to runway 05 for departure. The flight was airborne at 10:59, reaching a height of 300 feet. After passing the end of the runway, the airplane began to descend rapidly. The nose wheel hit the roof of a building from the Compañía Ecuatoriana del Caucho rubber processing company. The Cessna struck a wall and came to rest nose-down."
1682,ACC1656,"Cessna 208 N208WE was owned by Cessna and used to market Caravans to customers. The Caravan's regional sales manager for the western U.S. and Canada departed the Cessna plant at Wichita-Cessna Aircraft Field, KS (CEA) on March 27. At North Las Vegas (VGT) the pilot met with the president of Pacific Aircraft Sales. Both men departed the next day to Kingman, AZ (IGM) and then on to Thermal (TRM). In the area of TRM, the two pilots conducted a demonstration flight for a prospective customer. After the demonstration flight an IFR flight plan was filed for a flight to Ontario, CA (ONT) with a planned en route altitude of 10,000 feet. The airplane departed at approximately 16:35. About 16:55 the flight had reached an altitude of about 8500 feet. At that time the Southern California Terminal Radar Approach Control controller advised the pilots that radar contact was established that they were heading into rising terrain. The controller asked, ""Do you have the terrain in sight?"" At 16:55:03, one of the pilots responded ""8 Whiskey Echo, we're maneuvering away from the terrain right now."" Nine seconds later radio contact was lost. The Cessna struck a ridge and crashed. The elevation at the accident site was 6,073 feet."
1685,ACC1659,"The pilot was performing the 12th flight of the day spraying crops. Before the 12th takeoff the pilot allowed to two unauthorized persons to go on board, an 11-year old boy, who occupied a right seat, and a 22-year old man, who was standing behind the seats. Takeoff was performed at 14:51. During the left turn at a speed of 140-150 km/h the An-2 descended from altitude of 5-10 m, struck the ground, left lower wing first, crashed and was destroyed by fire. Both adult men were killed while the boy suffered the serious injures."

1687,ACC1661,Armavia flight 967 departed Yerevan (EVN) at 00:47 on a scheduled flight to Sochi (AER). Weather at Sochi was poor with rain and poor visibility. Radio contact with Sochi was established at 01:10. The flight crew discussed the current weather conditions at Sochi with the approach controller. At 01:26 the crew decided to return to Yerevan due to the below minima weather conditions at Sochi. At 01:30 the crew again requested the latest weather information. Visibility now was reported as 3600 m with a cloud base at 170 m. The captain now decided to continue to Sochi instead. Clearance was give to descent to an altitude of 3600 m. At 02:00 further descent instructions for 1800 m were issued by the air traffic controller. Weather conditions for an approach to runway 06 were now equal to the airport minima. Sochi Tower then cleared the flight to descend to 600 m. The glideslope was captured and the gear was lowered at 02:10. The crew reported ready and where cleared for landing. Weather was reported as 4000 m visibility with a cloud base at 190 m. Weather deteriorated quickly and thirty seconds later the controller reported that the cloud base was now at 100 m. He instructed the flight to abort the approach and told the crew to make a climbing right hand turn to an altitude of 600 m. The aircraft was flying at 300 m and performed a climbing turn to 450 m. Simultaneously the groundspeed dropped and the Airbus descended until it contacted the water and broke up. Wreckage sank to a depth of 700 m.
1688,ACC1662,"The accident aircraft, a Convair 580A, was one of two aircraft that had recently been delivered to the Government of Saskatchewan's Northern Air Operations. CV-580As had been converted to aerial tankers (water bombers) for fighting forest fires. The accident flight was a training flight that consisted of stop-and-go circuits at the La Ronge Airport (YVC). The purpose of the training was to instruct and cross-qualify new CV-580A captains as first officers for future training requirements. The first two circuits were unremarkable; all altitudes, speeds, and aircraft performance were as expected for the exercises being carried out.The final approach leg of the third circuit differed from the first two in that the aircraft's speed was lower. The airspeed was stabilized at 103 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS). The rate of descent and respective altitudes were unstable compared with those of the first two circuits. The captain had called for a power setting of 150 to 200 hp on both engines on short final approach, and the flaps, which had been set at 24°, were selected to 28°. The aircraft entered a high sink rate of approximately 1280 feet per minute.In an effort to arrest the high sink rate, the captain, who was the pilot flying, called for increased power, briefly increased pitch attitude, and then touched down on the runway, approximately 200 feet beyond the threshold. The first officer, the pilot not flying, responded to the captain's call for power by rapidly advancing both power levers to a point beyond the maximum power setting limit. When the power levers were advanced, the left propeller immediately autofeathered and the left engine shut down. The captain, noting the position of the power levers, quickly retarded them to a position he assumed would give maximum power.During the final approach leg and on the go-around, the captain was not continuously setting or monitoring the engine power settings and consequently was unaware of the engine power or the nature of the emergency. The elapsed time between encountering the high sink rate and initiating the go-around was approximately seven seconds.After touching down on the runway, the captain, believing that the aircraft was not aligned with the runway, initiated a go-around. The autofeather was not called out or identified as an emergency. The decision to go around was not called out or communicated to the first officer. The go-around was commenced at an airspeed of approximately 94 KIAS (V1 minus 2)1. The gear was then selected up during a momentary positive rate of climb and the flaps were retracted at an airspeed of 95 KIAS, after the aircraft cleared the VOR radio range transmitter located left of the departure end of runway 36.Shortly after the aircraft became airborne, its left wing dropped slightly and could not be righted. The airspeed fluctuated between 93 and 98 KIAS and would not increase with a positive pitch angle. Once the flaps were retracted at 95 KIAS, the angle of bank increased uncontrollably. The aircraft started to descend, and collided with trees and terrain in a wooded area on the airport property."

1694,ACC1668,"Servicing remote airports in Nepal, the Yeti Airlines Twin Otter departed Nepalganj (KEP) for a flight to Jumla (JUM) via Surkhet (SKH). The flight took off from Surket at 11:35 with 6 passengers, 941 kg of cargo including food grains and three crew members on board. The total take off weight of aircraft was 12,499 lb (5669 kg) which included 1400 lb (635 kg)  of fuel.The weather report at Jumla at that time was fair with bright sunshine and north easterly 02 knots wind. The wind direction had changed at the time of take off from south westerly.The aircraft left Surkhet valley and established contact with Nepalgunj Tower as per normal procedure. At 11:49 the aircraft reported 'Virgin Pass', one of the reporting points en-route to Jumla.At 11:55 the aircraft established contact with Jumla Information and received weather information and runway 27 for landing. Wind was reported being 240 at 4 kts. The pilot decided to use runway 09 and reported turning final at 12:01. The aircraft appeared on final approach with high speed. The captain carried out missed approach without informing Jumla control tower. He coordinated his position and intention to use runway 27 with the pilot of aircraft 9N-AHR operated by Sita Air which was to land 7 minutes behind him. The captain flew over to the right of Jumla control tower, while executing the missed approach and headed towards a hill. The captain then made a sharp left turn with a high bank angle with an intention to land on runway 27 while informing to vacate the runway for trailing 9N-AHR aircraft. During this process the aircraft lost speed as well as altitude considerably and hit the paddy field to the east of the airport. The Twin Otter bounced up and traversed a further 200 feet approximately or so ultimately hitting a terrace, cart wheeled came to rest turning 180 degrees with tail section twisted. It instantly caught fire."
1699,ACC1673,"A Fokker F-27 Friendship 200 passenger plane, registered AP-BAL, was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Multan Airport (MUX), Pakistan. All 41 passengers and four crew members were killed.Pakistan International Airlines flight PK-688 was a scheduled service from Multan to Lahore Airport (LHE), Pakistan.During the roll for take off on runway 36 at a speed of about 60-70 kts, an unidentified pump was observed to be malfunctioning about which the aircrew showed their concern.Subsequently the aircraft started to veer to the right side but the captain was able to straighten it to the runway direction in the right half of the runway. At a speed of about 90 kts, the captain asked his co-pilot if the right engine torque was less, which was confirmed by the co-pilot.After another 5 seconds, the co-pilot announced the V1 speed (around 108-110 kts). The aircraft lifted off at a speed of 120 kts, which was above the scheduled Vr.Some 44 seconds after initiation of the take off roll, the right engine flamed out (spooled down) and the prop auto feathered. The gear was not raised and the crew started securing the engine below an altitude of 400 feet, which was contrary to emergency procedures. Meanwhile the airplane was drifting to the right. Because the gears were not raised and the aircraft was not wings level, the speed started to decrease. Consequently the aircraft stopped climbing at 150-160 feet AGL. Some 40 seconds after takeoff the aircraft stalled and crashed. A fire erupted."

1708,ACC1682,"A Boeing 737-200 passenger plane, registered 5N-BFK, was destroyed when it crashed near Abuja International Airport (ABV), Nigeria. There were 100 passengers on board and five crew members. Eight passengers and one crew member survived the accident.ADC Airlines Flight 53 departed Lagos (LOS) on a scheduled domestic flight to Sokoto (SKO) with an intermediate stop at Abuja (ABV). At Abuja at 11:14 local time, the crew of the aircraft requested start-up clearance. This was given along with the prevailing weather information. At 11:21, the crew requested clearance to taxi to the holding point and a wind check; both were given. Over the following six minutes Abuja Tower gave a series of six wind reports, including a statement emphasizing the gusty nature of the wind. A thunderstorm was approaching the airport and weather was worsening. At 11:26, the crew of flight 53 requested clearance for immediate takeoff, and the controller re-emphasized the deteriorating weather condition and gave latest wind check, which they acknowledged.Immediately after takeoff from runway 22, the Boeing 737 entered into a headwind -shift to-tailwind windshear, which significantly affected the aerodynamic performance of the airplane.The Pilot Flying responded to the windshear by adding a small amount of power and by pulling back on the control column causing a significant pitch attitude change.The Pilot-not-flying responded to the windshear by calling for the Pilot Flying to pull up. The airplane then entered into a full aerodynamic stall followed by a roll to the left of over 90 degrees and steep descent into the ground. The aircraft was pitched to an attitude that resulted in the temporary disruption of airflow to and momentary loss of power in both engines. The airplane broke up and caught fire in a corn field."

Flight 706Hughes Airwest Flight 706 was a regularly scheduled flight from Los Angeles, California, to Seattle, Washington, with intermediate stops at Salt Lake City, Utah, Boise and Lewiston, Idaho, and Pasco and Yakima, Washington.The flight departed Los Angeles International Airport at 18:02 local time and following radar vectors from Los Angeles Departure Control, contacted the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at 18:06. The flight reported leaving 12,000 feet at 18:09, and the controller advised, ""Air West seven zero six red, turn left heading zero four zero until receiving Daggett proceed direct."" RW706 acknowledged, ""OK. zero four zero direct to Daggett."" This was the last recorded transmission from the flight.PhantomThe U.S. Marine Corps F-4B Phantom, 151458, was part of a two-ship formation that had departed the Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, California on June 4, 1971 on an overnight cross-country return flight to McChord Air Force Base (AFB), Washington. During a refueling stop at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, on the way back, 151458 was grounded for repairs to have mechanical difficulties checked out. The radar and transponder were inoperative, there as an oxygen system leak and the radar system were degraded. Meanwhile the flight leader continued back to MCAS El Toro.Maintenance personnel replaced a fuse to fix the radio, but they did not have the personnel to check the transponder. They confirmed the oxygen leak, but could not repair it. No attempt was made to restore the radar to peak performance at that time. The crew of 151458 then flew to Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS) Fallon, Nevada, for further repairs.The maintenance personnel on duty at NAAS Fallon were unable to provide the appropriate repairs, so it was decided that the Phantom should continue to MCAS El Toro at low altitude.The flight departed at 17:16, climbed initially to 7500 feet, and then climbed to 15500 feet to clear mountains and some clouds. After crossing the mountains, they descended to 5500 feet and later further down to 1000 feet. Due to deteriorating visibility, they again climbed to 15500 feet northwest of Palmdale. The Radar Intercept Officer (RIO) was operating the radar in the mapping mode, but, due to the extremely degraded air-to-air detection capability, no airborne targets were seen. CollisionAt 18:11 both crew members of the Phantom jet suddenly noticed the DC-9 on their right hand side. The pilot initiated an evasive roll but a collision could not be avoided.The Phantom struck the forward fuselage of the DC-9, causing the nose section of the DC-9 the separate from the fuselage. The F-4 began to tumble violently about the lateral axis and the RIO ejected from the aircraft. He parachuted to the ground without injury. The DC-9 crashed in a wooded canyon with approximately 60° slopes"

At 19:48, air traffic control cleared TW350 out of controlled airspace via the Sandy Bay runway 05 non-directional beacon approach. The crew flew the approach straight-in to runway 05 and initiated a go-around from the landing flare. The aircraft did not maintain a positive rate of climb during the go-around and collided with trees just beyond the departure end of the runway. All four occupants survived the impact and evacuated the aircraft. The captain died of his injuries before rescuers arrived. Both emergency medical technicians were seriously injured, and the first officer received minor injuries. The aircraft sustained substantial damage from impact forces and was subsequently destroyed by a post-impact fire."

1723,ACC1697,"A Beechcraft 200C Super King Air, VQ-TIU, crashed soon after takeoff from North Caicos Airport (NCA), at the start of a flight bound for Grand Turk Island Airport (GDT), Turks and Caicos Islands. On board were one pilot and five passengers. The pilot received fatal injuries in the accident; the passengers mostly suffered serious injuries. Weather conditions at the time were good, but it was after nightfall; the moon had not risen and there was little cultural lighting in the area.The aircraft crashed into a shallow lagoon approximately one nautical mile south-east of North Caicos Airport. Wreckage was spread along a trail that extended in excess of 370 m along a track of 220°(M). The aircraft's fuselage had come to rest comparatively intact, although lying in an inverted attitude. Evidence from the accident site indicated that the aircraft had struck the water in a nominally upright attitude, with only a moderate rate of descent but at relatively high forward speed.From a detailed examination of the wreckage and the circumstances of the accident, it was concluded that the aircraft was structurally intact and probably under control when it struck the surface. The evidence indicated that each engine was producing power throughout the short flight and at the time of impact. Although anomalies were found which suggested that a possible power asymmetry may have existed, this should not have been sufficient to cause the pilot serious control difficulties.None of the passengers described an obvious problem with the aircraft during the flight, and most remained unaware of the impending crash. The circumstances of the accident suggested that the pilot became spatially disorientated, to the extent that the aircraft diverged from its intended flight path and reached an irrecoverable situation. The environmental conditions were conducive to a disorientation event, and a postmortem toxicological examination showed that the pilot had a level of blood alcohol which, although below the prescribed limit, was significant in terms of piloting an aircraft and would have made him more prone to disorientation.The evidence indicated that the pilot had probably started a recovery to normal flight, but too late to prevent the accident. However, his actions had the effect of reducing the descent rate and placing the aircraft in a nearly level attitude at impact. This lessened the impact damage and helped preserve the fuselage structure relatively intact, increasing the passengers' chance of survival."
1725,ACC1699,"The Cessna Caravan operated out of Goma regularly. On February 15 the airplane departed for Walikale, carrying food. Weather at Walikale was poor. The pilot made three attempts to land.

The DC-3 became airborne again and arched downward over the cliffs, into the ocean and crashed 150 yds offshore. The pilot had failed to remove the rudder and elevator gust locks."
1729,ACC1703,"UTair Aviation flight 471 departed Surgut (SGC) on a regular domestic flight to Belgorod (EGO) via Samara (KUF). Upon departure from Surgut, the weather at Samara was below minima with a visibility of 200 m in fog. An improvement was expected to a visibility of 3000 m upon arrival.The Tupolev Tu-134 took off at 04:08 UTC, climbing to the cruising altitude of 10600 m. En route weather reports showed an improvement to a visibility of 1500 m at Samara. At 06:18 UTC (11:18 local time), shortly after contacting Samara Control, the captain briefed the crew about the arrival procedures for Samara. During the briefing he incorrectly stated that the altitude at which they would capture the glide slope was 500 m (the actual height is 400 m according to the approach charts). About 06:22, Samara Control cleared the flight to descend to 5400 m. During their descent, about 06:30, the ground wind at Samara Airport changed direction from west (270-290°) to southeast (120°) with fog again worsening the visibility.Samara Approach cleared the flight further down to 2400 m and reported of 1200 m with haze and fog. At 06:35 the crew received further clearances in preparation for an approach to runway 23 and the controller reported pressure at the airfield being 745 mm Hg.At 06:37 visibility dropped to 800 m. The meteorological station officer did not inform air traffic control, although he was aware of this significant drop in visibility. Shortly afterward a visibility of 608 m was registered, which was below airport landing minima. This value was not noted by the met station officer and thus not passed on to ATC. At 06:38:53 the flight reported at 400 m. The crew was then instructed to contact the Samara Landing controller, which they did. At 06:40 UCT air traffic control contacted the met station to inquire about the cloud base and horizontal visibility. The met officer reported fog with 800 m visibility but did not mention the cloud base. The cloud base according to the latest ATIS information was 490 m. The actual cloud base measured at the time of the approach was about 30 m.At 06:40:10, at a speed of 380 km/h, the flight engineer lowered the landing gear and the captain trimmed the stabilizer. At 06:40:43, at a speed of 350 km/h, the flaps were extended to 20 degrees. At the same time, the Tu-134 was 10 km on finals, the controller reported the (incorrect) visibility of ""800 m in fog"". At 06:41:09., 8 km out, at a speed of 320 km/h, the flaps were set at 30 degrees. At 06:41:45 the airplane passed the Outer Marker at 200 m. The navigator failed to inform the crew that they had passed the Outer Marker. Thus the pilot did not inform the controller, in order to obtain landing clearance. When the controller inquired about their position, the crew reported ready for landing. At 06:41:55 they were cleared to land. The vertical rate of descent was 6 m/s, which exceeded the recommended rate of descent. The aircraft passed the Inner Marker at a height of 60 m, and a vertical rate of descent of 5,5 m/s with a lateral deviation from the runway axis to the right, no less than 40 m with a further tendency to the right. At decision height the crew had not established positive visual contact with the approach lights. The approach was continued until the airplane contacted the ground, at 06:42:33, 300 m short of the runway and 100 m to the right of the extended centreline. The left wing separated from the fuselage and the plane rolled on its back."

1741,ACC1715,"The Cessna Caravan N208EC was based in Weston Aerodrome outside Dublin. The airplane was requested by the Clifden Airport Committee for a trial flight. The purpose of the flight was a demonstration of an aircraft to a group of potential investors and interested parties associated with a proposed airport at Clifden, Co. Galway, some 25 nm to the northwest of Connemara. The pilot flew to Connemara-Inverin in the morning together with an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist and conducted a familiarisation flight to Inishmaan (Inis Meáin). The group assembled at Connemara, but as there were too many passengers to be accommodated on one aircraft, two flights were proposed with the aircraft returning to pick up the remainder. The aircraft then departed with the first part of the group. On arrival at Inishmaan, the pilot contacted those remaining and informed them that he would not be returning for them because he was uncomfortable with the weather. This did not cause a problem because an Aer Arran Islander aircraft, with its pilot, was available to fly the remainder of the group across to Inishmaan.Following lunch and a presentation the group returned to Connemara. N208EC took off with eight passengers on board. There had been a significant wind shift, since the time the aircraft had departed earlier from Connemara that morning, of which the pilot appeared to be unaware. As a result a landing was attempted downwind on runway 05. At a late stage, a go-around was initiated, at a very low speed and high power setting. The aircraft turned to the left, did not gain altitude and maintained a horizontal trajectory. It hit a mound, left wing first and cartwheeled. The pilot and one of the passengers were fatally injured. The remaining seven passengers were seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed but there was no fire."

1753,ACC1727,"A Beechcraft A100 King Air, N30GC, impacted trees about 3/4 mile from the departure end of runway 26R at Chino Airport (CNO), CA. The wreckage came to rest inverted in an open field located on the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) facility near the airport. The airplane was destroyed. The commercial instrument rated pilot and the passenger were fatally injured. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed for the flight. The reported weather at the time of the accident was calm winds, a 1/4-mile visibility in fog and a vertical visibility of 100 feet. Shortly after takeoff for the instrument-flight-rules flight, the airplane made a slight turn to the left and impacted the tops of 25-foot trees about a 1/2 mile from the runway. An enhanced ground proximity warning system was installed on the airplane and data extraction from the system indicated that the airplane achieved an initial positive climb profile with a slight turn to the left and then a descent. A witness reported hearing the crash and observed the right wing impact the ground and burst into flames. The airplane then cartwheeled for several hundred feet before coming to rest inverted. The airframe, engines, and propeller assemblies were inspected with no mechanical anomalies noted that would have precluded normal flight."

1758,ACC1732,"Alpine Air flight 253 departed Honolulu (HNL) at 04:43 carrying about 4,200 pounds of mail on a regularly scheduled flight to Kauai, Lihue (LIH).It was scheduled to arrive at Lihue at 05:15. The pilot had routine contact with air traffic control, and was advised by the controller to maintain 6,000 feet at 05:01 when the airplane was 11 miles from the destination airport. Two minutes later the flight was cleared for a visual approach to follow a preceding Boeing 737 (Aloha Airlines Flight 917) and advised to switch to the common traffic advisory frequency at the airport. The pilot altered his flight course to the west, most likely for spacing from the airplane ahead, and descended into the water as he began a turn back toward the airport. The majority of the wreckage sank in 4,800 feet of water.The pilot most likely descended into the ocean because he became spatially disoriented. Although visual meteorological conditions prevailed, no natural horizon and few external visual references were available during the visual approach. This increased the importance of monitoring flight instruments to maintain awareness of the airplane attitude and altitude. The pilot's tasks during the approach, however, included maintaining visual separation from the airplane ahead and lining up with the destination runway. These tasks required visual attention outside the cockpit. These competing tasks probably created shifting visual frames of reference, left the pilot vulnerable to common visual and vestibular illusions, and reduced his awareness of the airplane's attitude, altitude and trajectory."
1759,ACC1733,"The airplane crashed into a mountain during an approach to land at Huambo Airport (NOV), Angola. Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed. The pilot, copilot and eleven passengers were fatally injured. The airplane was destroyed and there was ground fire.Weather was poor (rainy and foggy). Preliminary reports suggests the aircraft was flying below the minimum safe altitude over the mountainous area."
1761,ACC1735,"The Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1 N102PT was parked in a hangar at Augusta State Airport, ME (AUG) in the morning, at the pilot's request. However, the airline that used the hangar needed to house a plane. Since they had priority, the Citation was taken out of the hangar about 16:30 and moved back to the ramp area. While the airplane was on the ramp, the weather condition had turned from light snow to freezing rain. The pilot and her passenger arrived at the airport about 17:15. About 1730, the airplane's engines were started and the airplane was observed taxing. The FBO representative heard the pilot's announcements over the radio in the FBO. He also noticed the airplane was not on the taxiway, but on the grass area on the south side of the asphalt taxiway. At that time the ground was covered with snow and ice. The FBO representative noted the pilot did not activate the airport's taxi and runways lights via the common airport frequency radio channel. It was observed that the airplane taxied through a ditch, which was covered with ice and snow. The airplane's engines were heard at a high rate of power about this time. It was later discovered that the airplane's left main tire broke through the ice and became stuck in the ditch. The airplane continued on the grass area after the high engine power was heard. The FBO representative heard the pilot announce the wrong runway (runway 35) that she was planning to depart from. The FBO representative turned on the runway and taxi lights after hearing the incorrect runway announcement. The pilot later announced a change of departure from runway 35 to runway 17, while the airplane was observed back taxing on runway 26 onto taxiway ""C"". About 17:45 the airplane took off from runway 17.After takeoff, the pilot contacted the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) and reported that she was at 1,000 feet, climbing to 10,000 feet. About one minutelater, the pilot declared an emergency and stated, ""We've got an attitude indicator failure"". About seven seconds later, the pilot announced over the frequency they were not certain which way they were turning. Radar contact was lost shortly after that."
200,ACC174,"Alaska Airlines, Flight 1866 (AS66) was a scheduled passenger flight from Anchorage (ANC), to Seattle (SEA), with intermediate stops at Cordova (CDV), Yakutat (YAK), Juneau (JNU), and Sitka (SIT). The IFR flight departed Anchorage at 09:13 and landed at Cordova at 09:42. AS66 departed Cordova at 10:34 after a delay, part of which was attributable to difficulty in securing a cargo compartment door. The flight landed at Yakutat at 11:07. While on the ground, AS66 received an air traffic control clearance to the Juneau Airport via Jet Route 507 to the Pleasant Intersection, direct to Juneau, to maintain 9,000 feet or below until 15 miles southeast of Yakutat on course, then to climb to and maintain FL230. The flight departed Yakutat at 11:35, with 104 passengers and seven crew members on board.At 11:46, AS66 contacted the Anchorage ARTCC and reported level at FL230, 65 miles east of Yakutat. The flight was then cleared to descend at the pilot's discretion to maintain 10,000 ft so as to cross the Pleasant Intersection at 10,000 feet and was issued a clearance limit to the Howard Intersection.The clearance was acknowledged correctly by the captain and the controller provided the Juneau altimeter setting of 29.46 inches and requested AS66 to report leaving 11,000 ft. At 11:51, AS66 reported leaving FL230. Following this report, the flight's clearance limit was changed to the Pleasant Intersection. At 11:54, the controller instructed AS66 to maintain 12,000 feet. Approximately 1 minute later, the flight reported level at 12,000 feet. The changes to the flight's original clearance to the Howard Intersection were explained to AS66 by the controller as follows: ""I've got an airplane that's not following his clearance, I've got to find out where he is."" The controller was referring to N799Y, a Piper Apache which had departed Juneau at 11:44 on an IFR clearance, destination Whitehorse, Canada. On two separate occasions, AS66 acted as communications relay between the controller and N799Y. At 11:58, AS66 reported that they were at the Pleasant Intersection, entering the holding pattern, whereupon the controller recleared the flight to Howard Intersection via the Juneau localizer. In response to the controller's query as to whether the flight was ""on top"" at 12,000 feet, the captain stated that the flight was ""on instruments."" At 12:00, the controller repeated the flight's clearance to hold at Howard Intersection and issued an expected approach time of 12:10. At 12:01, AS66 reported that they were at Howard, holding 12,000 feet. Six minutes later, AS66 was queried with respect to the flight's direction of holding and its position in the holding pattern. When the controller was advised that the flight had just completed its inbound turn and was on the localizer, inbound to Howard, he cleared AS66 for a straight-in LDA approach, to cross Howard at or below 9,000 feet inbound. The captain acknowledged the clearance and reported leaving 12,000 feet. At 12:08 the captain reported ""leaving five thousand five ... four thousand five hundred,"" whereupon the controller instructed AS66 to contact Juneau Tower. Contact with the tower was established shortly thereafter when the captain reported, ""Alaska sixty-six Barlow inbound."" (Barlow Intersection is located about 10 nautical miles west of the Juneau Airport). The Juneau Tower Controller responded, ""Alaska 66, understand, ah, I didn't, ah, copy the intersection, landing runway 08, the wind 080° at 22 occasional gusts to 28, the altimeter now 29.47, time is 09 1/2, call us by Barlow"".

At 04:18 local time the aircraft began the takeoff roll. The aircraft failed to become airborne and continued rolling past the end of the runway into the sand. It crossed a service road and crashed into buildings in a military zone 500 meters from the runway end.After the accident numerous safety violations were discovered. The service life of the aircraft had expired and the Sao Tome authorities did not inspect the aircraft prior to issuing a temporary Certificate of Airworthiness and ferry permit. The engines and propellers had reprinted numbers plates without documentation to confirm their service life or airworthiness. Additionally, the engines on the aircraft were of different types (AI-20M and AI-20K).The crew did not have enough time for rest. The decision of the crew to fly was influenced by the fact that the temporary certificate of airworthiness expired on 20 February, 2009."

1836,ACC1810,"On the day before the accident, the Ilyushin Il-76MD transport plane delivered a batch of cargo to Mirny, Russia. During taxiing after landing, the crew activated the electrical part of the rudder and aileron locking system. The ""Lock On"" light illuminated. On the morning of the next day, a ferry flight to Chita was planned, with an en route stop at Irkutsk.In the course of preflight checks, the crew took steps to bring the electromechanical part of the locking system to the ""disengaged"" position. At the same time the ""Lock on"" light remained illuminated. Accepting it as a false alarm, the captain decided to take off. The operability of the aileron control system was checked by deflecting the steering wheel to the left and then to the right. During deflection to the right, the right aileron was locked due to its locking mechanism. At 07:48 the flight took off in darkness from runway 24. At the beginning of the takeoff run, the engine power was set to a position below the takeoff mode, which did not provide an audible warning of the locked position of the steering wheels and ailerons. In the course of the takeoff run, the aircraft began to move to the right. After becoming airborne, a roll of 8 degrees occurred, which continued to increase intensively. The crew tried to counteract the banking moment by deflecting the controls to the left. The movement of the steering wheel to the left was limited by the mechanism of locking the right aileron. At 59 seconds of flight with a roll of about 90 degrees at a speed of 364 km/h the plane impacted the ground at a distance of 1893 m from the runway and broke up."

1880,ACC1854,"A Fugro Aviation Canada CASA C-212-CC40, C-FDKM, was destroyed in a forced landing accident in Saskatoon, SK, Canada. One of the three crew members was killed.The airplane departed Saskatoon Airport, SK (YXE) at 15:03 for a geophysical survey flight to the east of Saskatoon. At about 18:14 the aircraft experienced a shudder from the right engine just before it smoothly spooled down. The propeller rotation slowed and the aircraft yawed. The right engine torque fell below 20%. The crew confirmed that the right engine had lost power. Altitude at the time was 2300 feet and the 2 survey sensors were deployed behind and below the aircraft.The captain set maximum power on the left engine and the crew commenced to shut down the right hand engine. As the first officer had more experience on the aircraft than the captain, the pilots agreed to let the FO continue as pilot flying. The captain would continue with the checklists and radio communications.At 18:17 the captain notified the Saskatoon control tower of the situation with a MAYDAY call, advising they had lost power on one engine and were returning to Saskatoon. By 18:18, the aircraft had climbed to 2600 feet asl and accelerated to about 99 KIAS, and the pilots had instructed the survey equipment operator to recover the survey sensors. The survey equipment operator got up to do so. The recovery process took 4 to 5 minutes. At 18:25, the flight reached 3100 feet asl (about 1400 agl), the maximum altitude following the right engine power loss.By 18:27, airspeed was about 105 to 110 KIAS, and both pilots had visual contact with the runway. The FO's plan was to fly a high steep approach, and he had not yet reduced the left engine power lever setting for the approach. The tower cleared the flight to land on runway 27.Meanwhile the fuel level left tank or fuel pressure left engine annunciators had illuminated, along with the master caution light. Neither pilot observed these annunciations.At about 18:28, airspeed was 105 KIAS or greater when the left engine smoothly lost power with no surging. The captain observed the torque indicator smoothly and rapidly decreasing from 100% to 20% within a couple of seconds. The airplane decelerated and yawed to the left. The altitude was 3000 feet asl (about 1300 feet agl). Both pilots immediately concluded the flight would not reach the runway, and the captain pointed out a large street to the FO as a feasible forced landing site and the FO concurred. Neither pilot could see any better alternative. The left hand prop was then feathered.The FO maintained control of the aircraft throughout the descent. Airspeed slowed initially to 100 KIAS and later to 90 KIAS. The goal was to control the descent and impact, with a minimum airspeed of 90 KIAS to prevent a departure from controlled flight. The pilots observed traffic on the road. They revised the intended touchdown site to the grass beside 51st Street, to the right of the traffic and light poles and the left of what they perceived as a frangible fence.Late in the descent the pilots identified that the fence was actually a noise abatement wall. The FO concluded that the flight could not be extended beyond the noise abatement wall and advised the other crew members. The aircraft landed astride the wall at 90 KIAS. When the aircraft came to a stop, the captain turned off the batteries and the master switch and pressed the cockpit engine fire extinguisher buttons."

The two pilots and the two flight test engineers were fatally injured.The accident occurred during a planned one-engine-inoperative (OEI) takeoff when a stall on the right outboard wing produced a rolling moment that the flight crew was not able to control, which led to the right wingtip contacting the runway and the airplane departing the runway from the right side. After departing the runway, the airplane impacted a concrete structure and an airport weather station, resulting in extensive structural damage and a postcrash fire that completely consumed the fuselage and cabin interior.The National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) investigation of this accident found that the airplane stalled while lifting off the ground. As a result, the NTSB examined the role of ""ground effect"" on the airplane's performance. Ground effect refers to changes in the airflow over the airplane resulting from the proximity of the airplane to the ground. Ground effect results in increased lift and reduced drag at a given angle of attack (AOA) as well as a reduction in the stall AOA. In preparing for the G650 field performance flight tests, Gulfstream considered ground effect when predicting the airplane's takeoff performance capability but overestimated the in ground effect stall AOA. Consequently, the airplane's AOA threshold for stick shaker (stall warning) activation and the corresponding pitch limit indicator (on the primary flight display) were set too high, and the flight crew received no tactile or visual warning before the actual stall occurred.The accident flight was the third time that a right outboard wing stall occurred during G650 flight testing. Gulfstream did not determine (until after the accident) that the cause of two previous uncommanded roll events was a stall of the right outboard wing at a lower-than-expected AOA. (Similar to the accident circumstances, the two previous events occurred during liftoff; however, the right wingtip did not contact the runway during either of these events.) If Gulfstream had performed an in-depth aerodynamic analysis of these events shortly after they occurred, the company could have recognized before the accident that the actual in-ground-effect stall AOA was lower than predicted.During field performance testing before the accident, the G650 consistently exceeded target takeoff safety speeds (V2). V2 is the speed that an airplane attains at or before a height above the ground of 35 feet with one engine inoperative. Gulfstream needed to resolve these V2 exceedances because achieving the planned V2 speeds was necessary to maintain the airplane's 6,000-foot takeoff performance guarantee (at standard sea level conditions). If the G650 did not meet this takeoff performance guarantee, then the airplane could only operate on longer runways. However, a key assumption that Gulfstream used to develop takeoff speeds was flawed and resulted in V2 speeds that were too low and takeoff distances that were longer than anticipated.Rather than determining the root cause for the V2 exceedance problem, Gulfstream attempted to reduce the V2 speeds and the takeoff distances by modifying the piloting technique used to rotate the airplane for takeoff. Further, Gulfstream did not validate the speeds using a simulation or physics-based dynamic analysis before or during field performance testing. If the company had done so, then it could have recognized that the target V2 speeds could not be achieved even with the modified piloting technique. In addition, the difficulties in achieving the target V2 speeds were exacerbated in late March 2011 when the company reduced the target pitch angle for some takeoff tests without an accompanying increase in the takeoff speeds.Gulfstream maintained an aggressive schedule for the G650 flight test program so that the company could obtain Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) type certification by the third quarter of 2011. The schedule pressure, combined with inadequately developed organizational processes for technical oversight and safety management, led to a strong focus on keeping the program moving and a reluctance to challenge key assumptions and highlight anomalous airplane behavior during tests that could slow the pace of the program. These factors likely contributed to key errors, including the development of unachievable takeoff speeds, as well as the superficial review of the two previous uncommanded roll events, which allowed the company's overestimation of the in-ground-effect stall AOA to remain undetected."
1884,ACC1858,"A Saab 340A passenger plane, registered LV-CEJ, was destroyed when it crashed 20 km north of Prahuaniyeu, Argentina. The 19 passengers and three crew members on board did not survive the accident.The airplane operated on SOL Líneas Aéreas flight 5428 from Córdoba (COR) to Mendoza (MDZ), Neuquén (NQN) and Comodoro Rivadavia (CRD). The flight departed Neuquén at 20:05 for the final leg of the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL190. After flying for 24 minutes, the pilot levelled the aircraft at 17800 ft, and remained at this level for approximately 9 minutes.When flying at FL179, the aircraft began to pick up ice. The copilot radioed air traffic control for permission to descent. The flight was then cleared down to FL140. However, while descending the crew members commented on the growing ice accretion on the wind shield and wings. By the time the aircraft had reached FL140, the icing conditions were severe. The aircraft flew for approximately two minutes with a straight and level flight attitude, increasing the accumulation of ice.The airspeed dropped until the airplane stalled. The pilots attempted to regain control of the plane, but failed. The airplane impacted terrain and burned."
1890,ACC1864,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan was destroyed when it crashed on takeoff from Pukatawagan Airport, MB (XPK), Canada. There were eight passengers on board and one pilot. One passenger was killed in the accident.During the takeoff run on runway 33, the aircraft's airspeed indicator initially rose as the aircraft accelerated and its nose wheel lifted off the runway. The flaps were set to 20° and the engine produced rated power. During the takeoff roll, the aircraft encountered several soft spots near the taxiway intersection. The pilot applied rearward pressure on the control yoke and one or both main wheels briefly lifted off the runway, but the airspeed stopped increasing and the aircraft did not remain airborne. The pilot rejected the takeoff with an estimated 600 feet of runway remaining. The pilot selected engine power to idle, reverse propeller thrust, and flaps to 0° to maximize braking traction. The aircraft continued past the end of runway 33. The aircraft was travelling at a relatively low speed but the pilot was unable to stop before the aircraft dropped off the steep slope and proceeded down an embankment before coming to rest in a ravine. As a result of the impact, the aircraft was damaged and its fuel system was compromised. A post-crash fire ensued. The airplane was owned by Beaver Air Service, which flies under the name Missinippi Airways."
1894,ACC1868,"A Boeing 737-200 passenger plane was destroyed when it flew into terrain while on approach to Resolute Bay Airport, NU (YRB), Canada. There were 11 passengers and four crew members on board. Eight passengers and all four crew members were killed.The airplane had departed Yellowknife Airport, NT (YZF) on a domestic charter flight to Resolute Bay. During the approach to Runway 35T, the aircraft impacted a hill at 396 feet above sea level (asl) and about 1 nautical mile east of the midpoint of the Resolute Bay Airport runway which, itself, is at 215 feet asl. The crew had initiated a go-around 2 seconds before impact. At this time, the flaps were set to position 40, the landing gear was down and locked, the speed was 157 knots and the final landing checklist was complete.In the hours before the accident, the weather in Resolute Bay was variable with fluctuations in visibility and cloud ceiling. Forty minutes before the accident, the visibility was 10 miles in light drizzle with an overcast ceiling at 700 feet above ground level (agl). A weather observation taken shortly after the accident, reported visibility of 5 miles in light drizzle and mist with an overcast ceiling of 300 feet agl."
1896,ACC1870,"The Antonov An-2 crashed during an emergency landing killing one of the two occupants. The An-2 burst into flames and was completely destroyed.The airplane operated on a crop spraying flight in the Slavyansk-na-Kubani district of the Krasnodar region.The engine lost power shortly after takeoff due to the use of sub-standard E95 fuel. The pilot started to drop the load of chemicals and attempted an emergency landing in a soya field but the aircraft hit the slope of an irrigation drain, nosed over into the drain and burnt."
1898,ACC1872,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N207DR, and a Cessna T207A Turbo Stationair 7 airplane, N73789, collided in midair, approximately 14 km north of Nightmute, Alaska. Both airplanes were being operated as visual flight rules (VFR) charter flights in visual meteorological conditions when the accident occurred. The Cessna 208B was operated by Grant Aviation and the Cessna 207 was operated by Ryan Air. The sole occupant of the Cessna 208B sustained fatal injuries. The sole occupant of the Cessna 207 was uninjured. Both airplanes sustained substantial damage during the midair collision. After the collision, the Cessna 208B descended, uncontrolled, and impacted tundra-covered terrain. A postcrash fire consumed most of the wreckage. The Cessna 207 was further damaged during a forced landing on tundra-covered terrain. Both airplanes were based at the Bethel Airport, Alaska. The Cessna 208B departed from the Toksook Bay Airport (OOK) about 13:25, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the flight to Bethel. The Cessna 207 departed from the Tununak Airport, Alaska, about 13:15, and VFR company flight following procedures were in effect for the return flight to Bethel.Both pilots had a close personal relationship. After takeoff from Tununak, the pilot of the Cessna 207 talked with the pilot of the Cessna 208B on a prearranged, discreet radio frequency, and the two agreed to rendezvous for the flight back to Bethel. She said that while in cruise level flight at 1,200 feet msl, en route to Bethel, the pilot of the Cessna 208B flew his airplane along the left side of her airplane, and they continued to talk via radio. She said that the pilot of the Cessna 208B then unexpectedly and unannounced climbed his airplane above, and overtop of her airplane. She immediately told the pilot of the 208B that she could not see him, and she was concerned about where he was. She said the 208B pilot then said, in part: ""Whatever you do, don't pull up."" Moments later, the next thing she recalls was the 208B's impact with her airplane's right wing.The 207 pilot reported that after the impact, she saw the 208B pass underneath her airplane, and it began a gradual descent, which steepened as the airplane continued to the left and away from her airplane. She said that she told the pilot of the 208B that she thought she was going to crash. The pilot of the 208B stated that he also thought he was going to crash. She said that she watched as the 208B continued to descend, then it entered a steep, vertical, nose down descent, before it collided with the ground. She said a postcrash fire started instantaneously upon impact. The 207 pilot said that while struggling to maintain control of her airplane, she was unable to maintain altitude, and she selected an area of rolling, tundra-covered terrain as a forced landing site. She said that during the emergency descent, she had limited roll control, and the airplane's stall horn was on during the entire emergency approach. The airplane touched down on the soft terrain, and the nose landing gear collapsed. The Cessna 208B's severed vertical stabilizer and rudder assemblies were found about one-half mile west of the main wreckage site, and along the two airplanes' reported flight route. A large portion of the Cessna 207's right aileron was found near the 208's rudder and stabilizer."
1899,ACC1873,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan I was destroyed when it crashed in the Yahukimo District, Indonesia. Both crew members were killed.The airplane was being operated on a non-scheduled cargo flight from Wamena Airport to Kenyam Aerodrome in Papua, Indonesia. The flight was being conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) and the pilot reported to ATC that the planned altitude was 9,500 feet.On board the aircraft were two pilots, a manifested load of diesel drums and grocery items, and a non-manifested load of 25 bags of rice weighing 827 lb (375 kg). The takeoff weight, based on the manifested cargo and the additional load of rice was estimated by the investigation to be 9,681 lb (4,391 Kg) which was 619 lb (281 Kg) above the certificated maximum takeoff weight. Also, the aircraft Centre of Gravity (C of G) was outside the certificated C of G envelope.The aircraft took off from Wamena runway 15 at 12:17 local time. The aircraft was then flown along a track toward Kenyam which was consistent with the route used by other company pilots and previously flown by the pilot in command. The additional loading contributed to a reduced rate of climb during the flight which resulted in the aircraft being below 10,000 ft as it approached the high terrain. This altitude was 1,500 ft lower than the altitude specified in the operator's route guide for operations between Wamena and Kenyam, and lower than the altitude flown by other company pilots when operating in the area, including three other flights on the day of the accident which overflew the high terrain between 11,200 and 12,500 ft.At 12:29:43, as the aircraft approached the high terrain at an altitude of 9,538 ft, the airspeed commenced decreasing which was accompanied by the average rate of climb increasing to about 390 fpm. It is probable that the pilots recognized the proximity of the terrain and attempted to improve the aircraft's angle of climb by decelerating towards the best angle of climb speed of 72 kts. The recorded data showed that 31 seconds after the airspeed started to decrease, the engine power varied with a maximum engine torque of 1,675 ft/lb being recorded at 12:30:30 with changes in the other engine parameters being consistent with a selection of a higher power setting. This is likely to have been associated with the pilot's attempts to improve terrain clearance.The recorded data then showed the aircraft in a descending right turn for about 6 seconds. The altitude reduced over a period of 4 seconds from 9,865 ft to 9,728 ft at an average rate of descent of about 2,000 fpm. This turn was likely to have been initiated to either avoid cloud or improve terrain clearance. The aircraft subsequently commenced to roll to the left at 12:30:35 with the left roll continuing for the following 14 seconds. It was likely that the left turn was initiated to avoid either cloud or terrain. During the left turn, the angle of bank reached a maximum value of 46° and the aircraft descended from 9,728 ft to 9,045 ft at a high rate of descent. The airspeed also increased from 92 kts to 122 kts during the descent. The engine power was reduced to idle soon after the aircraft commenced descending which was most likely due to the handling pilot attempting to recover from the high descent rate and increasing airspeed. The recorded data indicated that three EGPWS alerts activated during the descent.The aircraft had stopped descending at 12:30:50 and had commenced climbing with a reducing left angle of bank when the airplane impacted terrain at an elevation of 9,100 feet."
1901,ACC1875,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300 float plane sustained substantial damage when it crashed in a street next to Yellowknife Waterdrome, NT, Canada. Both pilots were killed and five of the seven passengers were injured.The airplane had departed from Thor Lake, NT at 12:48 on a flight to the Yellowknife Waterdome. The first officer (FO) was acting as the pilot flying (PF) in the right seat, and the captain was the pilot not flying (PNF) in the left seat. The crew obtained weather information from the Yellowknife Airport automatic terminal information service (ATIS) and briefed their planned approach to the waterdrome. When joining a left base for landing, C-GARW was advised by the Yellowknife Airport control tower, located about 6 nautical miles (11 km) west of the waterdrome, that the winds at the airport were variable from the southwest at 10 knots, gusting to 30 knots. Due to the 2 to 3-foot waves (rollers) on the lake, the crew planned their approach so as to land close to the shore and to avoid entering the passage between the shore and Jolliffe Island. The captain also advised that the airspeed should be kept above 80 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS), which is 10 KIAS above the normal approach speed of 70 KIAS, for the full-flap (37.5°) approach and landing. During the approach, the captain cautioned the FO twice about the airspeed getting too low. The aircraft touched down in the intended landing area and bounced, then contacted the water a second time with the right float first. The float dug in, and the aircraft yawed to the right, turning towards the shore. The stall warning sounded for about 0.3 seconds.Without declaring that he was taking control, the captain placed his right hand on the power lever over the FO's left hand and initiated full power for a go-around. C-GARW lifted off in a nose-high, right-wing-low attitude, in a right turn that continued at a low altitude over the shore and toward the buildings in Old Town, Yellowknife. At this time, the captain called for the flaps to be raised to 20°, to which the FO responded. However, the flaps were not moved before impact. The right wing contacted power lines, causing the aircraft to rotate to a nose-down attitude. The bottom of the floats then contacted the side of a 3-storey office building. C-GARW dropped to the ground on its nose section, then cart-wheeled to its left into an adjacent parking lot. The stall warning intermittently activated throughout the go-around until just prior to impact.The total elapsed time from the initiation of the go-around to the command that flaps be set to 20° was about 4 seconds, and, from that command to the final impact, about 6 seconds. The maximum altitude gained was approximately 50 feet above ground.Numerous witnesses to the accident were on scene immediately to assist in evacuating the passengers. There was no fire, although a considerable amount of fuel was spilled."

1928,ACC1902,"A Lockheed  P2V-7 Neptune (Air Tanker mod.) N14447, coded ""Tanker 11"", under contract to the US Forest Service, crashed about 20 miles north of Modena, Iron County, Utah, during a fire fighting operation against the White Rock Fire in the Hamblin Valley Area.Tanker 11 departed the tanker base to conduct its second fire retardant drop of the day in the same location. Upon arriving in the fire traffic area, Tanker 11 followed the lead airplane into the drop zone, which was located in a shallow valley 0.4 mile wide and 350 feet deep. The lead airplane flew a shallow right turn onto final and then dropped to an altitude of 150 feet above the valley floor while approaching the intended drop zone. While making the right turn onto final behind the lead airplane, Tanker 11's right wing tip collided with terrain, which resulted in a rapid right yaw and subsequent impact with terrain. The wreckage created a 1,088-foot-long debris field, and a post impact fire ensued. Two witnesses took photographs of the accident sequence photos, and an examination of these photographs showed that the lead airplane was positioned ahead of the tanker throughout the flight; however, the orientation of the lead airplane compared to the orientation of Tanker 11 indicated that Tanker 11 did not directly follow the lead airplane's path to the final drop course. Rather, it was about 700 feet left of the lead airplane's path and made a wider right turn as it attempted to align with the final drop course. The accident flight crewmembers had previously flown nearly the same exact drop and the lead pilot cautioned them about tailwind conditions during the flight; however, the wider turn suggests that they did not properly compensate for the wind conditions while maneuvering. In addition, the previous flight was conducted at an altitude above the ridgeline. GPS evidence indicates that the accident flight was conducted below the ridgeline, which would have made it more difficult to detect the rising terrain during the wider turn. A review of the airplane's cockpit voice recorder audio information revealed that the flight crew did not recognize or attempt to correct the reduced clearance between Tanker 11 and the rising terrain until about 2 seconds before impact."

1946,ACC1920,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, operated by Gogal Air Service, struck terrain shortly after takeoff from Snow Lake Airport, MB, Canada. The pilot died and the seven passengers were injured. Gogal Air Services was engaged by a local mining company to transport employees between Snow Lake and Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Caravan had accumulated some rime ice on the leading edges of the wings and the horizontal stabilizer from the flight into Snow Lake on the previous day. During the pre-flight inspection, the pilot tapped the leading edges of the wings with a broom handle in an attempt to remove the ice, but did not do this on the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft. Ice remained on the leading edges of the wings and tail before the flight. No de-icing or anti-icing fluids were applied to the wing or horizontal stabilizer, and no tactile inspection of the upper wing or tail surfaces was observed.The airplane departed at 09:55 and climbed to about 225 feet above ground level. It then pitched down. The aircraft's tail began to shudder and oscillate, the wings rocked, and a more pronounced second downward pitch ensued before the aircraft contacted the trees and crashed. There was no fire."
1951,ACC1925,"A Beechcraft B100 King Air turboprop plane was destroyed when it struck terrain on top of Swede Mountain, north northeast of Libby Airport, MT, USA. The pilot and passenger were killed. The flight left Coolidge Municipal Airport, AZ about 20:25 on December 18, piloted by the CEO of Stinger Welding Inc. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported that the pilot had been cleared for the GPS-A instrument approach procedure for the Libby Airport. The clearance had a crossing restriction of 10,700 feet at the PACCE intersection, which was the initial approach fix for the GPS-A approach. The pilot acknowledged that clearance at 23:53. At 23:59, the airplane target was about 7 miles south of the airport; the pilot reported the field in sight, and cancelled the IFR flight plan.A police officer reported that he observed an airplane fly over the city of Libby, which was north of the airport; the airplane then turned toward the airport. The officer went to the airport to investigate, but observed no airplane. He noted that it was foggy in town, but the airport was clear. He also observed that the rotating beacon was illuminated, but not the pilot controlled runway lighting.The flight was reported overdue during the day; the wreckage was located at 18:35 on a tree covered slope.	The town and airport were located within a sparsely populated area that had limited lighting conditions, which, along with the clouds and 35 percent moon illumination, would have restricted the pilots visual references. These conditions likely led to his being geographically disoriented (lost) and his subsequent failure to maintain sufficient altitude to clear terrain. Although the pilot did not possess a valid pilots certificate, a review of his logbooks indicated that he had considerable experience flying the airplane, usually while accompanied by another pilot, and that he had flown in both visual and IFR conditions. A previous student pilot medical certificate indicated that the pilot was color blind and listed limitations for flying at night and for using color signals. The pilot had applied for another student pilot certificate 2 months before the accident, but this certificate was deferred pending a medical review."
1952,ACC1926,"A Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III passenger plane was involved in an accident at Sanikiluaq Airport, NU (YSK), Canada. The flight crew sustained serious injuries, 6 passengers sustained minor injuries and one passenger, an infant, was fatally injured. The route from Winnipeg to Sanikiluaq is normally operated by Keewatin Air, a Perimeter Aviation sister company. The normally scheduled flight on the previous day (Friday, 21 December 2012) had been cancelled due to poor weather in Sanikiluaq. With extra cargo and passengers needing to travel to Sanikiluaq before Christmas, Keewatin Air completed a flight on the morning of 22 December 2012 and had chartered Perimeter to complete an additional flight. The Perimeter flight crew had been notified in the early evening of 21 December 2012 that they would be operating flight PAG993 the next morning.Following an attempted visual approach to runway 09, a non-precision non-directional beacon (NDB) runway 27 approach was conducted. Visual contact with the runway environment was made and a circling for runway 09 initiated. Visual contact with the runway 09 environment was lost and a return to the Sanikiluaq NDB was executed. A second NDB runway 27 approach was conducted with the intent to land on runway 27. Visual contact with the runway environment was made after passing the missed approach point. Following a steep descent, a rejected landing was initiated at 20 to 50 feet above the runway; the aircraft struck the ground approximately 525 feet beyond the departure end of runway 27."
1954,ACC1928,"An Air Bagan Fokker 100 aircraft registered XY-AGC departed Yangon International Airport, Myanmar on a domestic scheduled passenger flight to Mandalay International Airport with the captain as pilot flying. The aircraft was refueled at Mandalay after 60 passengers disembarked and 46 passengers boarded. The captain made the briefing and completed the aircraft checks. At 08:26 local time, the flight departed Mandalay to Heho Airport. The first officer was designated as the Pilot Flying for the flight. The aircraft climbed to FL130 and the captain contacted Heho ATC at 50 NM from Heho. Heho ATC provided the present weather condition (wind calm, visibility 3000 m, distinct fog, temperature 17°C, QNH 1018 mb, runway 36 in use). At about 08:36 local time, the first officer started the crew briefing. The aircraft started descend to 9000 ft and continued to overhead the Heho NDB. At about 08:47 local time, while heading 220 degrees and descending to 6000 ft the flight commenced a non-precision Non Directional Beacon (NDB) approach to runway 36.During the final inbound track at about 2.5 NM to the runway at 08:52, the EGPWS aural warning called out ""500"". The captain initiated ""Alt hold"" at about 08:53, just before the EGPWS alert ""100"" ""50"" 40"" ""30"" and the aircraft struck 66 KV power lines, trees, telephone cables, a fence and collided with terrain short of the runway, coming to rest approximately 0.7 NM from the threshold. During the ground collision, both wings separated and a fire commenced almost immediately. An emergency evacuation was initiated by the cabin crews. One aircraft occupant and one motorcyclist on the ground were fatally injured, 70 of the occupants and one motorcyclist survived and the aircraft was destroyed by fire."
1955,ACC1929,"A Canadair CRJ-200 operated by SCAT was destroyed in an accident near Almaty Airport (ALA), Kazakhstan, killing all 16 passengers and five crew members. Flight DV760 operated on a domestic flight from Kokshetau Airport (KOV) to Almaty (ALA).Weather forecast obtained by the crew before departure showed a visibility of 800 m at Almaty with a vertical visibility of 90 m, and temporary reduced visibility to 200 meters. The flight took off at 11:19 hours local time. The captain was Pilot Flying.At 12:00 the flight contacted Almaty Control and received the current weather conditions which showed a limited visibility for runway 23R of 200 m. At 12:40 the flight was cleared to descend to FL80. By then visibility had decreased to 175 m. The captain decided to continue descent and prepare for an approach to decision height. The captain became increasingly stressed by the poor weather conditions. After reaching FL80 the crew were told to remain at that altitude because of another flight in the area.This provoked a strong emotional reaction from the captain.At 12:57 the flight was then cleared down to 1600 m. During the descent the lack of improvement of weather conditions caused a greater and greater irritation on the part of the captain. When turning to finals the runway visual range (RVR) for the first, mid and last part of runway 23R was reported as 275-250-225 m in freezing fog with a vertical visibility of 40 meters. With continuing visibility updates the flight crew kept descending until it was clear that a landing was impossible given the lack of visual contact with the ground.A missed approach was initiated at 13:10 from a height of 180 m. The autopilot was disconnected and the TO/GA button was pushed. Engine power increased and the flaps were raised to 8°. In the four seconds after pressing to TO/GA button there were no control inputs. Then the captain pushed the control column forward, causing the aircraft to descend. The EGPWS warning sounded as the pitch changed to -9. The observer pilot tried to draw attention on the EGPWS warning but there was no response on the controls by the flight crew. Pitch angle further increased to -16° and vertical speed was -20 to -30 m/sec. The aircraft impacted the ground at high speed and a -20° pitch angle and broke up."
1958,ACC1932,"A Fokker 50 passenger plane, operated by Compagnie Africaine d'Aviation (CAA) was destroyed in an accident near Goma Airport (GOM), Democratic Republic of the Congo. There were ten people on board the Fokker 50, three passengers, six crew members and a loadmaster. The three passengers survived the accident.The airplane reportedly came down in a residential area as it was preparing to land in poor weather following a domestic flight from Goma Airport (GOM)."
1959,ACC1933,"A Beechcraft 1900 cargo plane was destroyed when it impacted rising terrain some 32 km northeast of Dillingham Municipal Airport, AK (DLG). Both crew members were killed. The flight had originally departed Anchorage, AK (ANC) about 05:44, and made a scheduled stop at King Salmon, AK (AKN), before continuing on to the next scheduled stop, Dillingham, AK (DLG). As the airplane approached Dillingham, the flight crew requested the RNAV GPS 19 instrument approach to the Dillingham Airport about 07:57 from controllers at the Anchorage Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). The ARTCC specialist on duty subsequently granted the request by issuing the clearance, with instructions to proceed direct to the Initial Approach Fix (IAF) to begin the approach, and to maintain an altitude of 2,000 feet or above. A short time later the flight crew requested to enter a holding pattern at the IAF so that they could contact the Flight Service Station (FSS) for a runway conditions report, and the ARTCC specialist granted that request. The ARTCC specialist then made several attempts to contact the aircraft, but was unsuccessful and subsequently lost radar track on the aircraft. An ELT signal indicated it had come down in the Muklung Hills. The wreckage was located the next day at an altitude of 2000 feet on the south side of the Muklung Hills."
1966,ACC1940,"An Antonov 2R biplane was destroyed in an accident in the Aksy district of Kyrgyzstan, killing all three on board.The airplane operated on a fumigation flight to combat locusts on a hillside. It contacted power lines at a height of 15 m when flying into the sun."
1971,ACC1945,"The airplane, a Cessna 208 Caravan I, was en route from Thad to Cameroon flying at 3000 feet when the engine lost power. The aircraft impacted terrain during an attempted diversion to N'Gaoundere Airport, Cameroon. The aircraft sustained substantial damage and one of the two pilots onboard received fatal injuries. The remaining four occupants were hospitalized with undisclosed injuries."
1977,ACC1951,"An Embraer EMB-110P1 Bandeirante aircraft crashed while on approach to Francistown Airport (FRW), Botswana, killing both crew members.The airplane was en route from Lanseria to Lubumbashi (FBM), D.R. Congo when it attempted to land at Francistown, a regular refuelling stop.Aviation sources report that the aircraft did an instrument approach due to shallow fog. The crew performed a go-around, then told the tower they could see the runway and were going to approach from the opposite direction. The airplane crashed in a bushy area."
1979,ACC1953,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-3T Texas Turbine Otter crashed during takeoff from runway 25 at Soldotna Airport, AK (SXQ), killing all ten on board. The plane crashed with its right wing down and nose low and came to rest 2,320 feet from the threshold of the runway, in a grassy area 154 feet to the right of the runway centreline. A fire destroyed much of the aircraft.A video taken by one of the passengers during takeoff was analysed by investigators. Speed started declining as soon as the airplane took off and the angle of attack increased. The airplane stalled at an altitude of 120 feet at a speed of about 44 mph.Baggage that was recovered after the accident weighed 613 lbs (278 kg) in total. The load manifest listed a total cargo weight of 300 lbs (136 kg), based on an estimate made by the operator of the lodge where the passengers were headed."
1983,ACC1957,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air was destroyed in an accident near Akureyri Airport (AEY), Iceland. A medic and the captain were killed. The other pilot received minor injuries.The air ambulance plane had transported a patient from Höfn to Reykjavik, Iceland and was returning to the home base at Akureyri Airport. The repositioning flight departed Reykjavik at 12:44 hours local time and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL170.During cruise, the flight crew discussed the captain's wish to deviate from the planned route to, in order to fly over a racetrack area near the airport. At the racetrack, a race was about to start at that time. The commander had planned to visit the racetrack area after landing.The aircraft approached Akureyri from the south and at 10.5 DME the flight crew cancelled IFR. When passing KN locator (KRISTNES), the flight crew made a request to Akureyri Tower to overfly the town of Akureyri, before landing. The request was approved by the tower and the flight crew was informed that a Fokker 50 was ready for departure on runway 01. The flight crew of TF-MYX responded and informed that they would keep west of the airfield. After passing KN, the altitude was approximately 800 ft MSL. The co-pilot mentioned to the commander that they were a bit low and recommended a higher altitude. The altitude was then momentarily increased to 1000 ft.When approaching the racetrack area, the aircraft entered a steep left turn. During the turn, the altitude dropped until the aircraft hit the racetrack. The left wing touched the ground and the airplane broke up while impacting terrain at Hlíðarfjall Road, northwest of Akureyri Airport. A post-impact fire erupted."

1990,ACC1964,"A Dornier 228 passenger plane was destroyed when it crashed near Viña del Mar Airport (KNA), Chile. Both pilots were killed.The airplane operated on a repositioning flight from Los Pelambres Airport to Viña del Mar. There it would pick up workers for the Los Pelambres mine.The airplane approached in poor visibility conditions. The ILS glideslope was inoperative so the crew conducted a non precision approach to runway 05. The aircraft descended below the minimum descent altitude, struck power lines and trees and crashed in a field."
1991,ACC1965,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan was damaged beyond repair after impacting the water of Hudson Bay, Canada. A visual flight rules (VFR) flight plan had been filed for a local flight in the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, ON. The airplane was overdue and an ELT signal was picked up 1,200 kilometres north of Sault Ste. Marie.Search and rescue parties located debris consistent with a plane crash in the waters of Hudson Bay the next morning. There was no sign of the pilot. Debris was located in an area about 500 kilometres east of Churchill, MB., 200 kilometres from Fort Severn, ON."
1992,ACC1966,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander airplane crashed at sea off Cayo Luis Peña, Puerto Rico, killing the pilot.The pilot originally departed from Culebra Airport (CPX) about 05:00, and flew to Ceiba, Puerto Rico, to pick up a load of Sunday newspapers. He then flew to Vieques (VQS) without incident, and was returning to Culebra at the time of the accident. The airplane impacted the water and was destroyed."
1994,ACC1968,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 310, operated by MASwings, sustained substantial damage in an accident at Kudat Airport (KUD), Malaysia. The copilot and one passenger died, four others were injured.MASwings flight MH3002 operated on a domestic flight from Kota Kinabalu Airport (BKI) to Kudat. The captain was the pilot flying for this sector and the first officer was pilot monitoring. As the aircraft was approaching Kudat Airfield, Kudat Tower reported the weather conditions to be: wind at 270 degrees at 17 kts gusting 31 kts.The aircraft continued the approach on runway 04 and leveled off at 500 feet with flaps set at 10°. At this point the crew noticed that the approach for runway 04 had a strong tail wind. This was evident from the indicated airspeed observed by the crew which indicated 100 kts where the airspeed for flaps 10° should be 65kts. The windsock also indicated a tail wind. Noticing the approach for runway 04 was a tail wind condition, the crew decided to go around at a height of 500ft.Maintaining runway heading, the crew initiated a go around climbing to 1,000ft making a left tear drop and reposition for runway 22. On the approach for runway 22 the captain informed the first officer that if they could not land they would return to Kota Kinabalu.The aircraft was aligned with the centerline of runway 22 and 20° flaps was set. The aircraft continued to descend to 300ft. At this point the wind appeared to be calm as the aircraft did not experience any turbulence and the captain told the first officer that he was committed to land. Upon reaching 200ft the captain called for the flaps to be lowered to full down.As they were about to flare the aircraft to land, approximately 20ft above the runway, the aircraft was suddenly hit by a gust of wind which caused the aircraft to veer to the right with the right wing low and left wing high and the nose was pointing 45° to the right of runway 22.The crew decided to go around by applying maximum power; however the aircraft did not manage to climb successfully. The flaps were not raised and were still in the full flaps down position as the crew thought the aircraft was still low hence the flaps were not raised. The aircraft continued to veer to the right with right wing low and managed to only climb at a shallow rate. The aircraft failed to clear the approaching trees ahead and was unable to continue its climb because the airspeed was reducing. The presence of a full flaps configuration made it more difficult for the aircraft to climb. As the aircraft was on full power on both the engines, it continued to fly almost perpendicularly in relation to the runway and at a low height above the ground.The aircraft hit a tree top at the airfield perimeter fencing, disappeared behind the row of trees, hit another tree behind a house.It hit the right rear roof of the house, ploughed through the roof top of the kitchen, toilet and dining area, hit the solid concrete pillars of the car garage and finally hit the lamp post just outside the house fence. It swung back onto the direction of the runway and came to rest on the ground with its left engine still running. A woman and her 11-year old son who were in the living room at the time escaped unhurt."
1997,ACC1971,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan was destroyed after impacting terrain near Loreto, Mexico. All fourteen on board were killed.The airplane departed Loreto Airport (LTO) at 09:01 on a domestic flight to Ciudad Constitución Airport (CUA) and Los Mochis.Contact with the aircraft was lost. The wreckage of the airplane was found on October 16 in the Sierra de La Giganta mountains."
2000,ACC1974,"Bearskin Airlines Flight JV311 crashed while on approach to runway 26 at Red Lake Airport, Ontario, Canada. Both pilots and three of the five passengers were killed in the accident. Flight 311 was a scheduled flight between Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Winnipeg, Manitoba, with stops in Sioux Lookout, Ontario, and Red Lake, Ontario. The flight from Thunder Bay and the subsequent departure from Sioux Lookout were uneventful. At 18:16, Winnipeg ACC cleared Bearskin 311 to the Red Lake Airport for the VOR/DME runway 26 approach, and advised the pilots to contact Kenora Flight Service Station (FSS).The descent checklist was carried out and, at 18:17, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they had been cleared by Winnipeg ACC for an approach to runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. Because the crew were expecting to encounter visual conditions prior to landing, a full approach briefing was not carried out.The landing checklist was completed and, at 18:27, the crew advised Kenora FSS that they were 5 nautical miles (nm) on final approach for runway 26 at the Red Lake Airport. At 18:28, at approximately 500 feet above ground level and approximately 1.4 nm from the runway, the crew noted an aircraft malfunction but did not immediately identify the nature of it. Maximum power was applied to one or both engines, and the landing gear was initially selected up and then re-selected down before it could fully retract. The crew declared an emergency with Kenora FSS and unsuccessfully attempted to initiate a climb. Shortly afterwards, the aircraft veered and rolled to the left, descended, and struck trees with its left wing. The aircraft continued through the trees and struck a series of hydro lines that ran parallel to Ontario Highway 125, before coming to rest in a wooded area adjacent to the highway.A post-crash fire erupted."
2002,ACC1976,"The aircraft, a Learjet 35A bound for Cozumel, Mexico, impacted the waters of the Atlantic Ocean about three miles northeast of Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport (KFLL), Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All four aboard were killed.The airplane had just completed an air ambulance flight for Air Evac International from San Jose, Costa Rica to Fort Lauderdale, and was repositioning back to its base in Cozumel, Mexico.The airplane departed Fort Lauderdale Airport runway 10R about 19:50. After the aircraft climbed straight ahead over the ocean to about 2,200 ft and 200 knots groundspeed, the copilot requested radar vectors back to the departure airport due to an ""engine failure."" The controller assigned an altitude and heading, and the copilot replied, ""not possible,"" and requested a 180-degree turn back to the airport, which the controller acknowledged and approved. However, the airplane continued a gradual left turn to the north as it slowed and descended. At 19:52:34 the crew radioed ""Mayday, mayday, mayday"". The Miami Departure controller instructed the crew to turn left, heading 260 and continued to give vectors for an approach to runway 28R.During the next 3 minutes, the copilot requested, received, and acknowledged multiple instructions from the controller to turn left to the southwest to return to the airport. However, the airplane continued its slow left turn and descent to the north. The airplane slowed to 140 knots and descended to 900 ft as it flew northbound, parallel to the shoreline, and away from the airport. Eventually, the airplane tracked in the direction of the airport, but it continued to descend and impacted the ocean about 1 mile offshore, broke up and sank.According to conversations recorded on the airplane's cockpit voice recorder, no checklists were called for, offered, or used by either flight crewmember during normal operations (before or during engine start, taxi, and takeoff) or following the announced in-flight emergency. After the ""engine failure"" was declared to the air traffic controller, the pilot asked the copilot for unspecified ""help"" because he did not ""know what's going on,"" and he could not identify the emergency or direct the copilot in any way with regard to managing or responding to the emergency. At no time did the copilot identify or verify a specific emergency or malfunction, and he did not provide any guidance or assistance to the pilot.Examination of the left engine's thrust reverser system components after salvage found that the upper blocker door was attached to the reverser and found in a partially deployed position."
2004,ACC1978,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, registered P2-SAH and operated by Tropicair, departed Kamusi for Purari River, Papua New Guinea at approximately 13:15 local time on a charter flight under the instrument flight rules (IFR). The aircraft was carrying a pilot and nine passengers. One of the passengers, in the right pilot seat, was a pilot about to begin training with the operator.Takeoff and climb from Kamusi were normal and the pilot levelled off at 9,000 ft above mean sea level and completed the appropriate checklist. Between Kamusi and Purari River the terrain is mostly flat and forest covered with areas of swampland and slow-moving tidal rivers. Habitation is very sparse with occasional small villages on the rivers. The weather was generally good in the area with a cloud base of 3,000 ft and good visibility between build-ups. Approximately two minutes into the cruise there was a loud 'pop' followed by a complete loss of engine power. After configuring the aircraft for best glide speed at 95 knots, the pilot turned the aircraft right towards the coast and rivers and completed the Phase 1 memory recall items for engine failure in flight. He was assisted by the passenger in the right pilot seat, who switched on the Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) and began broadcasting 'mayday' on the area frequency. Checking the database in the Global Positioning System (GPS), the pilot found the airstrip at Kibeni on the eastern side of the Palbuna River. Kibeni airstrip is disused, uneven, and short but it was the only open ground in the area on which the pilot could attempt a forced landing. The pilot, assisted by the passenger next to him, tried unsuccessfully to restart the engine. The passenger continued to give position reports and to communicate with other aircraft. At about 3,000 ft AMSL the pilot asked for radio silence on the area frequency so he could concentrate on the approach to Kibeni airstrip, flying a left hand circuit to land in a south westerly direction. He selected full flaps during the final stages of the approach, which arrested the aircraft's rate of descent and caused it to float. The wheels contacted the ground three times but this did not slow the aircraft enough to enable the pilot to stop it before the end of the airstrip.In order to clear the trees between the airstrip and the river, the pilot elected to pull up on the control column. The aircraft became airborne again, damaging the crown of a coconut palm as it passed over the trees between the end of the airstrip and the river. The pilot turned hard left and pushed forward on the control column to avoid stalling the aircraft. He levelled the wings before the aircraft impacted the water. The aircraft came to rest inverted and partially submerged, and immediately filled with water. After a short delay while he gained his bearings under water, the pilot was able to undo his harness and open the left cockpit door. He swam to the surface, opened the door at the rear of the fuselage, and helped the surviving passengers to safety on the river bank. After approximately 20 minutes, villagers arrived in a canoe and transported the pilot and surviving passengers across the river.Pratt & Whitney Canada examined the engine and concluded that the engine power loss was caused by the fracture of one Compressor Turbine (CT) blade in fatigue, which resulted in secondary damage to the remainder of the CT blades and downstream components. The fatigue originated from multiple origins on the pressure side of the blade trailing edge. The root cause for the fatigue initiation could not be determined with certainty."
2006,ACC1980,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan operated by Era Alaska crashed near Saint Mary's Airport, Alaska. The pilot and three passengers were killed in the accident. Six passengers sustained serious injuries. The airplane operated flight 7H-1453 from Bethel were it took off at 17:41. The flight was planned to make an intermediate stop at Mountain Village, but did not land there due to deteriorating weather. Night, instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) prevailed at the St. Mary's airport at the time of the accident.The airplane was seen to overfly the airport at low altitude. Shortly afterwards the flight impacted an open area of snow-covered tundra.About 8 minutes before the accident, at 18:16, a weather report indicated: Wind, 230 degrees at 7 knots; visibility, 3 statute miles; overcast at 300 feet above ground level; temperature, 18 degrees F (-7,8 degrees C); altimeter, 30.01 inches Hg."
2007,ACC1981,"An Embraer ERJ-190 passenger plane, operating flight TM470 from Maputo, Mozambique to Luanda, Angola, crashed in the Bwabwata National Park in Namibia. The airplane was destroyed and all 27 passengers and six crew members were killed.The flight departed Maputo at 11:26 local time (09:26 UTC) and was scheduled to land at Luanda at 14:10 local time (13:10 UTC). The airplane proceeded over Botswana at FL380 and was in contact with Gaborone ACC. At the EXEDU waypoint, about 13:09 local time (11:09 UTC), the aircraft commenced a sudden descent, which continued until the airplane impacted the ground at 11:16:26 UTC.Minutes before the crash the co-pilot left the cockpit for the lavatory. The captain then manually changed the altitude preselector from 38,000 feet to an altitude of 4,288 feet. This was changed to 1,888 feet and then to 592 feet. The auto throttle was manually reengaged and throttle lever then automatically retarded and set to idle. The airspeed was manually selected several times until the end of the recording, which remained close to the Vmo (maximum operating limit speed). During the descent the captain used the speed brake handle to activate the spoilers. On the cockpit voice recorder sounds were heard of someone pounding on the cockpit door.It was discovered that the captain went through numerous life experiences ranging from uncompleted divorce process, the suspected suicide of his son on November 21, 2012 and a recent heart surgery of his youngest daughter."
2008,ACC1982,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A-3 Islander, operated by Heringer Táxi Aéreo, crashed during a medical flight from Pikany village to Novo Progresso in Pará State. All five on board were killed.Immediately after takeoff the left engine failed, likely as a result of fuel exhaustion. The aircraft entered a steep descent and impacted trees in the Amazon forest."
2010,ACC1984,"The Makani Kai Air Cessna 208B Grand Caravan impacted ocean waters shortly after takeoff from Kalaupapa Airport (PHLU), on the island of Molokai in Hawaii. The airplane sustained substantial damage. The pilot and two passengers were seriously injured, one passenger was fatally injured, and five passengers received minor injuries. The pilot stated that shortly after takeoff from runway 05, at an altitude of about 400 feet above ground level (agl), he began a left turn for a downwind departure. Shortly after passing 500 feet agl, he motioned toward the power lever to reduce power for the climb when he heard a loud ""bang"" followed by an immediate loss of engine power. The pilot continued the turn toward land, verified the fuel valves were on, and observed all engine gauges displaying ""zero."" The pilot realized the airplane was not going to make it to land, and rolled the wings level while broadcasting a mayday distress call. Shortly after, the airplane landed within open ocean water in a flat or slightly nose up attitude.All the passengers and the pilot exited the airplane through the rear right door, and the airplane remained on the water surface for approximately 25 minutes before it sank. One passenger swam to shore, and United States Coast Guard and Maui Fire and Rescue helicopters recovered the pilot and 7 passengers from the water about 80 minutes after the ditching.The passenger who died before the first responders arrived was found wearing a partially inflated infant life vest.  Anotherpassenger reported that he also inadvertently used an infant life vest, which he said seemed ""small or tight"" but ""worked fine."" If the pilot had provided a safety briefing, as required by regulations, to the passengers that included the ditching procedures and location and usage of floatation equipment, the passengers might have been able to find and use the correct size flotation device."
2012,ACC1986,"A Canadair Challenger 601 corporate jet, registered N115WF, was destroyed in a landing accident at Aspen-Pitkin County Airport, CO (ASE). The copilot was fatally injured; the captain and the passenger received serious injuries.The flight originated from the Tucson International Airport (TUS), Arizona, at 10:04 and was bound for Aspen.The departure and en route portions of the flight were uneventful. As the flight neared its destination, a high-altitude, terrain-limited airport, air traffic control (ATC) provided vectors to the localizer/distance measuring equipment (LOC/DME)-E approach to runway 15. About 12:10, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 290º at 19 knots (kts) with gusts to 25 kts. About 12:11, the flight crew reported that they were executing a missed approach and then requested vectors for a second approach. ATC vectored the airplane for a second LOC/DME-E approach to runway 15. About 12:21, the local controller informed the flight crew that the wind was from 330° at 16 kts and the 1-minute average wind was from 320° at 14 kts gusting to 25 kts.The initial part of the airplane's second approach was as-expected for descent angle, flap setting, and spoilers. During the final minute of flight, the engines were advanced and retarded five times, and the airplane's airspeed varied between 135 kts and 150 kts. The final portion of the approach to the runway was not consistent with a stabilized approach. The airplane stayed nose down during its final descent and initial contact with the runway. The vertical acceleration and pitch parameters were consistent with the airplane pitch oscillating above the runway for a number of seconds before a hard runway contact, a gain in altitude, and a final impact into the runway at about 6 g.The weather at the time of the accident was near or in exceedance of the airplane's maximum tailwind and crosswind components for landing, as published in the airplane flight manual.Given the location of the airplane over the runway when the approach became unstabilized and terrain limitations of Aspen, performance calculations were completed to determine if the airplane could successfully perform a go-around. Assuming the crew had control of the airplane, and that the engines were advanced to the appropriate climb setting, anti-ice was off, and tailwinds were less than a sustained 25 kts, the airplane had the capability to complete a go-around, clearing the local obstacles along that path.Both flight crewmembers had recently completed simulator training for a type rating in the CL-600 airplane. The captain reported that he had a total of 12 to 14 hours of total flight time in the airplane type, including the time he trained in the simulator. The copilot would have had close to the same hours as the captain given that they attended flight training together. Neither flight crew member would have met the minimum flight time requirement of 25 hours to act as pilot-in-command under Part 135. The accident flight was conducted under Part 91, and therefore, the 25 hours requirement did not apply to this portion of their trip. Nevertheless, the additional flight time would have increased the crew's familiarity with the airplane and its limitation and likely improved their decision-making during the unstabilized approach."
2014,ACC1988,"The aircraft, a Cessna 208B Grand Caravan (Blackhawk VY conversion), Trans Guyana Airways Flight 700, on a shuttle operation between Olive Creek and Imbaimadai airstrip, impacted wooded terrain in the Mazaruni area. The airplane was destroyed. The pilot and cargo handler suffered fatal injuries. The aircraft took off from Olive Creek at 10:54, carrying fuel and other supplies for gold mining operations.Two and a half minutes after takeoff the engine lost power. The aircraft lost height and impacted an undulating and heavily forested area. Since only three of the seven oil drums were secured, the remaining four shifted forward during the crash.In June 2013 the aircraft received a Blackhawk modification, which consisted among others of the installation of a factory new P&W PT6A-42A engine."
2017,ACC1991,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter operated by Nepal Airlines was destroyed when it impacted a mountainside near Sandhikhark, Nepal. All 18 on board sustained fatal injuries.Flight RA183 was a domestic flight from Kathmandu to Jumla with a refueling stop at Pokhara. The airplane took off from Pokhara at 12:43. Upon leaving Pokhara Control Zone, the pilot in command realized that the direct track was not possible due weather and decided to proceed via a more southern track. During the flight the pilots were experiencing uncomfortable flying environment due to unfavorable weather conditions. Attempting to avoid the weather, the pilots had to fly up and down and changing the heading. Finally being unable to penetrate the weather ahead, the captain decided to divert to Bhairahawa, the nearest airport. However, the captain did not take into consideration the surrounding terrain and continued descent turning right. The aircraft initially slashed a small tree and finally impacted a ridge. Due to the heavy impact the left wing was first disintegrated and then the front part of the aircraft toppled over beyond the ridge with several subsequent impacts.The cockpit voice recorder showed that the copilot had warned the captain not to descend or turn.The wreckage was located the following morning at an altitude of 7190 feet (2192 m). There were no surivors."
2023,ACC1997,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan, N126AR, operated by Hageland Aviation Services impacted terrain in the Three Steps Mountain area about 60 km southeast of Bethel, Alaska. A post-crash fire erupted. Both pilots were killed.The flight was intended to be the first training flight of the newly hired second-in-command (SIC) pilot. The SIC was operating from the airplane's right seat during the training.The airplane departed Bethel Airport, Alaska, at 15:35. After departure, the airplane began a series of training maneuvers, consistent with normal operations. About 21 minutes into the flight, when the airplane was about 3,400 ft mean sea level, it began a steep descent and subsequently impacted terrain. An airplane performance study showed that the airplane reached a nose-down pitch of about -40 degrees and that the descent rate reached about 16,000 ft per minute. The NTSB determined that it is likely that the check airman simulated a pitch trim excursion and that the trainee, who lacked experience in the airplane type, did not appropriately respond to the excursion. The check airman did not take remedial action and initiate the recovery procedure in time to prevent the control forces from becoming unmanageable and to ensure that recovery from the associated dive was possible.The aircraft impacted frozen tundra and came to rest in an area of heavy willows."
226,ACC200,"The Yak-40 took off from Irkutsk Airport (IKT) at 22:29. While on approach the crew were given the weather information that was current at 23:15. The controller had not received more recent weather information, despite his requests. He knew the weather had deteriorated but he passed the older weather info on to the crew. On finals the flight entered an area with a wet snow storm, 1000 m visibility severe buffeting and wind gusts of 10-14 m/s. An intense downdraft caused the plane to contact trees. The airplane crashed and burned."
2026,ACC2000,"A Beechcraft B200 Super King Air crashed on a sand bar in the Río de la Plata, 10 km southwest of the destination Carmelo, Uruguay. Five occupants died.The aircraft departed San Fernando, Argentina,  at 12:22 on a short VFR flight to Carmelo Airport, Uruguay. The pilot first carried out an approach to runway 35 to observe the conditions. After going around, he decided to perform another approach with the intention to land. Visibility was poor, so the landing would only be carried if the pilot found a clear area.The aircraft was performing a left hand descending circuit when it impacted a mud flat in the waters of the Rio de la Plata."
2031,ACC2005,"An Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) 1124A Westwind II jet impacted a cotton field to the west of runway 18R at the Huntsville International Airport (KHSV) in Huntsville, Alabama. The airplane was consumed by a post-crash fire and the three occupants onboard were fatally injured.The purpose of the flight was pilot proficiency examinations for 2 company contracted pilots. The aircraft landed about 14:22 and entered a taxiway for a crew swap. The crew then contacted the Huntsville controller and reported that they wanted to fly two more ILS approaches before heading back to Birmingham Airport, AL (BHM). About 14:23, the controller cleared the flight for takeoff runway 18R, runway heading and provided the wind as from 280 at 5 knots. According to eyewitnesses the airplane climbed to 50-200 feet on takeoff and banked hard or steep right before crashing into a field in a nose and right wing low attitude."
2037,ACC2011,"A TransAsia Airways ATR-72 passenger plane was destroyed in an accident near Magong Airport (MZG), Taiwan. There were 58 persons on board. Ten passengers survived the accident.Flight GE222 had departed from Kaohsiung International Airport (KHH) at 17:43 on a scheduled domestic flight to Magong Airport, Penghu Islands, Taiwan. The flight had been delayed from 16:00 hours because of poor weather as a result of Typhoon Matmo that was passing through the area. The flight arrived near the Penghu Islands at 18:11 and entered a holding pattern to the northeast. The Magong airport has a single runway 02/20. Runway 02 offers an ILS approach, while for runway 20 a VOR/DME approach is available.At 18:27 the following weather information was passed on to the crew: runway 02: wind from 210 degrees at 5 knots, gusting to 11 knots; runway 20 wind from 190 degrees at 11 knots, gusting to 15 knots. Visibility was 800 meters.The crew then requested a runway 02 ILS approach and proceeded towards the south. At 18:43 a preceding UNI Air ATR-72-600, flight 647, requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This probably made the crew change their minds, since they subsequently also requested a VOR approach to runway 20. This was approved. The UNI Air flight landed at 18:56.At 19:03 the controller cleared the flight to land on runway 20, reporting wind from 250 degrees at 19 knots.At 19:05:44 the autopilot was disengaged an at about 19:05:58, the aircraft began to deviate to the left, descending below the glidepath. The flight had deviated about 340 m the left of the extended runway centreline when, at 19:06:11, the flight crew reported they were going around. About two seconds later the airplane contacted 5-6 m high trees, cutting a swath for about 100 meters. The airplane remained airborne for about 200 m until impacting a residential area. According to the Magong Airport flight schedule, 55 out of 66 flights to Magong were cancelled on July 23."

2053,ACC2027,"A Beechcraft 1900 was destroyed in an accident shortly after takeoff from Miami Executive Airport, FL (TMB) in Florida. All four occupants sustained fatal injuries.The airplane had undergone routine maintenance in Miami and was returning to Venezuela at the time of the accident. An NTSB review of maintenance records revealed that the left engine propeller had been due for overhaul. It was removed and replaced with an overhauled propeller prior to the accident flight and the accident flight was the first flight after the overhauled propeller was installed on the left engine. The flight was cleared for takeoff at 14:36:45 hours local time. At 14:38:15, one of the pilots reported an ""engine failure"" to air traffic control. The controller asked the pilot if he would like to return to the airport and the pilot replied affirmative. The controller then offered a 180-degree turn to runway 9R and the pilot requested a left traffic pattern to runway 27L, which the controller approved; however, the airplane subsequently impacted a utility pole and terrain about 4,5 km west of the runway.The highest altitude recorded on radar was 300 feet. A postcrash fire consumed a majority of the cockpit and cabin. It appeared that the no.1 engine prop feathered after takeoff and that the engine was shut down prior to the accident."
2060,ACC2034,"The Carson Air Swearingen SA226-TC Metro II was operating as flight 66, a weekday cargo flight between Vancouver International Airport (CYVR) and Fort St. John (CYXJ), British Columbia, Canada, with planned stops in Prince George (CYXS) and Dawson Creek (CYDQ).On the morning of the occurrence, CA66's first officer arrived at the airport at approximately 06:00. The first officer appeared to be in good spirits and spent about 5 minutes in the flight planning room before going to the aircraft to prepare it for that day's flights. The captain arrived at approximately 06:15 and went directly to the flight planning room to begin preparing the morning's flight plan. He appeared to be in a positive state of mind and spent a few minutes speaking with other company pilots who were also preparing to operate flights. He used a company computer to access weather information and placed a telephone call to NAV CANADA to file an instrument flight rules flight plan. No abnormal behaviour was observed by anyone with whom he had contact. The captain then walked to the aircraft and spent about 10 minutes in the flight deck before assisting the first officer with loading the flight's cargo. Final flight preparations were carried out by both flight crew members before they boarded the aircraft and started the engines, at about 06:45.At 07:03, CA66 began its take-off run. The aircraft lifted off after an approximate ground-run distance of 2800 to 3000 feet. This was within the expected normal performance for the aircraft type.Shortly after takeoff, CA66 contacted CYVR terminal departure control and was cleared to 9000 feet above sea level (ASL). A short time later, the air traffic controller assigned the flight a northbound heading. At 07:07, CYVR terminal departure control instructed CA66 to change radio frequencies and contact CYVR centre control. Upon initial contact with CYVR centre control, while climbing through 7500 feet, CA66 was again cleared to the aircraft's final flight planned altitude of flight level 200. At 07:08, the crew acknowledged a clearance to climb to flight level 200; this was CA66's last radio transmission. One minute and 20 seconds later, while climbing through an altitude of 8700 feet on an assigned heading of 350° magnetic, the aircraft disappeared from secondary surveillance radar displays at air traffic control.CA66's radar track, from the time it first became visible on radar at 07:02 until a steep descent toward ground, was approximately 7 minutes. The track showed an apparently routine climb from CYVR, at an average climb rate of 1500 feet per minute. Aircraft speed during the climb increased gradually until a ground speed of approximately 185 knots was reached.The last 3 radar returns from CA66 showed the aircraft beginning an abrupt, steep descent. At 07:09, a radar return showed that the aircraft was at 8700 feet; this was the highest altitude it reached. The 2 subsequent radar returns showed that the aircraft had dropped rapidly to 7600 feet and then 5000 feet while continuing in the direction of flight. There were no further returns.During the initial stage of the descent, the aircraft pitched down at about 6° per second, and its vertical acceleration reached -0.6g. The descent to 5000 feet likely occurred within 10 to 14 seconds. During that period, the aircraft's descent rate exceeded 30 000 feet per minute, and aerodynamic forces caused structural disintegration of the aircraft (in-flight breakup). There was no Mayday call or other communication from the aircraft during this period.Deteriorating weather conditions with low cloud and heavy snowfall hampered an air search; however, aircraft wreckage was found on steep, mountainous, snow-covered terrain by ground searchers at approximately 16:45. Both pilots had been fatally injured.Investigation showed that the captain had 0.24% blood alcohol content [BAC]. To obtain this, the captain would have had to consume approximately 17 to 20 standard drinks over a 12-hour period. An autopsy also identified focal severe coronary artery atherosclerosis and both steatosis and hepatitis in the captains liver. Finding these conditions in a 34-year-old person suggests excessive alcohol consumption over a significant period.The captain had recently applied for the position of Vancouver base chief pilot for the companys cargo operation. On 26 March 2015, the company advised him that the position had been awarded to another candidate. Around the same period, on 24 March 2015, 20 days before this accident, a first officer who had been having symptoms of depression and psychosis deliberately flew a Germanwings Airbus A320 into terrain, killing all on board.Although there were several coincidental factors, the investigation could not make any conclusions about the captains predisposition to committing an intentional act. Other scenario's like pitot system blockage or crew incapacitation were also considered, but deemed not very probable."
2063,ACC2037,"An Airbus A400M Atlas military transport plane was destroyed when it crashed near Sevilla Airport (SVQ), Spain during a test flight. Two of the six crew members survived the accident.The aircraft took off from runway 09 at 12:54 hours local time. The pilot, co-pilot, a mechanic and three engineers were conducting a test flight from Sevilla Airport (SVQ). The aircraft was built at the Airbus plant at Sevilla and was intended for the Turkish Air Force. It was the maiden flight after assembly.Shortly after takeoff three of the four engines became stuck at high power. Initially the three engines did not respond to the crews attempts to control the power setting in the normal way. Pilots then succeeded in reducing power only after selecting the thrust levers to idle. Then the engines remained stuck at idle. In an attempt to return to the airport, the aircraft struck powerlines, impacted a field and burned.An Airbus official after the accident stated that engine control software was incorrectly installed during final assembly of the aircraft. This led to engine failure and the resulting crash."

2073,ACC2047,"The float equipped DHC-3T Turbine Otter aircraft, operated by Promech Air, was destroyed when it impacted steep, mountainous tree-covered terrain about 25 miles northeast of Ketchikan above Ella Lake in the Misty Fjords area of Alaska. The pilot and eight passengers were killed.The accident airplane was the third of four Promech-operated float-equipped airplanes that departed at approximate 5-minute intervals from a floating dock in Rudyerd Bay. The accident flight and the two Promech flights that departed before it were carrying cruise-ship passengers who had a 12:30 ""all aboard"" time for their cruise ship that was scheduled to depart at 13:00. The sightseeing tour flight, which the cruise ship passengers had purchased from the cruise line as a shore excursion, overflew remote inland fjords; coastal waterways; and mountainous, tree-covered terrain in the Misty Fjords National Monument Wilderness.Promech pilots could choose between two standard tour routes between Rudyerd Bay and Ketchikan, referred to as the ""short route"" (which is about 52 nautical miles, takes about 25 minutes to complete, and is primarily over land) and the ""long route"" (which is about 63 nm, takes about 30 minutes to complete, and is primarily over seawater channels). Although the long route  was less scenic, it was generally preferred in poor weather conditions because it was primarily over water, which enabled the pilots to fly at lower altitudes beneath cloud layers. Route choice was at each pilot's discretion based on the pilot's assessment of the weather. The accident pilot and two other Promech pilots (one of whom was repositioning an empty airplane) chose the short route for the return leg, while the pilot of the second Promech flight to depart chose the long route. The accident flight encountered deteriorating weather conditions with terrain becoming obscured by overcast clouds with visibility restricted in rain and mist.Although the accident pilot had climbed the airplane to an altitude that would have provided safe terrain clearance had he followed the typical short route (which required the flight to pass two nearly identical mountains before turning west), the pilot instead deviated from that route and turned the airplane west early (after it passed only the first of the two mountains). The pilot's route deviation placed the airplane on a collision course with a 1,900-ft mountain, which it struck at an elevation of about 1,600 ft mean sea level. In the final 2 seconds of the flight, the airplane pitched up rapidly before colliding with terrain. The timing of this aggressive pitch-up maneuver strongly supports the scenario that the pilot continued the flight into near-zero visibility conditions, and, as soon as he realized that the flight was on a collision course with the terrain, he pulled aggressively on the elevator flight controls in an ineffective attempt to avoid the terrain."
2079,ACC2053,"The An-2 aircraft was prepared to conduct several aerial application flights from an airstrip in the vicinity of a farm in Stancuta commune, Romania.Onboard were the pilot and an aeronautical technician  who occupied the pilot's seat on the right.The take-off on the S-N direction was normal in the first part. The take-off run was short - approximately 100 m, according to a witness - under the conditions of a gusty wind from the easterly direction. During the initial climb, at a height of about 15-20 m, the aircraft began to lean to the left and descend slightly. During this turn in descent, bank angle continued to increase, the aircraft flying with the left wing at very low height above the aircraft parked towards the northern end of the airstrip. Observing that the pilot was not taking any avoiding action, the technician tried instinctively to turn the control yoke to the right. According to his statement the yoke was blocked.With the engine still running in take-off mode, the aircraft continued to descend, and after passing the parked aircraft, it hit the ground with the propeller and the left wing tip. The impact of the wing tip determined the aircraft to pivot to the left and make a hard contact with the ground.An early fire was extinguished by witnesses arrived at the accident site.Both occupants suffered serious injuries. Later on, the pilot died due to multiple traumatic injuries, and the passenger required a long hospitalization period due to the injuries suffered.The aircraft was totally destroyed."

The captain occupied the left seat and another pilot occupied the right. The second occupant worked for the operator of G-BYCP but his license was valid on Bombardier Challenger 300 and Embraer ERJ 135/145 aircraft and not on the King Air.The planned departure time of 08:15 hrs was delayed because of poor meteorological visibility. The general weather conditions were fog and low cloud with a calm wind. At approximately 08:50 hrs the visibility was judged to be approximately 600 m. At approximately 09:15 hrs the visibility was at least 1,000 m and the pilot decided that conditions were suitable for departure.The planned departure was to turn right after takeoff and intercept the 128° radial from Brookmans Park VOR (BPK) heading towards the beacon, and climb to a maximum altitude of 2,400 ft amsl to remain below the London TMA which has a lower limit of 2,500 ft amsl. The aircraft took off at 09:21 hrs and was observed climbing in a wings level attitude until it faded from view shortly after takeoff.After takeoff, the aircraft climbed on a track of approximately 205°M and, when passing approximately 750 ft amsl (565 ft aal), began to turn right. The aircraft continued to climb in the turn until it reached 875 ft amsl (690 ft aal) when it began to descend. The descent continued until the aircraft struck some trees at the edge of a field approximately 1.8 nm southwest of the airport.

2099,ACC2073,"The pilot and owner of the aircraft planned to fly his Eclipse 500 from Kuruman back to his home base at Cape Town, South Africa.He decided to make a detour and land at Lanseria to refuel. He met with an associate there and handed a suitcase as well as a briefcase to the secretary of the person he visited. He indicated that his wife would come and pick it up at some stage and gave her his wifes name and contact number with instructions to call her at 10:30 hours. The aircraft departed Lanseria Airport at 08:21 and climbed to the cruising altitude of FL360. The last radio contact with the flight was in the vicinity of Kimberley. The aircraft entered the FACA FIR (Area Control Centre) airspace without any communication from the pilot. During the course of these events, Air Traffic and Navigation Services tried in vain on all frequencies to make contact with the aircraft. Meanwhile, the Eclipse began to deviate from the planned route.At 10:37 the aircraft was observed to commence with a right turn, during which the height of the aircraft varied by 2000 feet, remaining between FL350 and FL370. The aircraft completed a 360° turn to the right and immediately commenced with a second right-hand turn. After it had completed the second 360° turn, it was observed to fly in an easterly direction for a brief period, during which the aircraft was observed to have climbed to an altitude of FL376, after which it descended and again entered into a right-hand turn at 10:44 at an altitude of FL330.The aircraft completed the third right-hand turn at 10:47 at an altitude of FL305. After completing the turn, it immediately entered into a fourth right-hand turn at an altitude of FL326 and a speed of 377 knots. The aircraft completed the 360° turn at 10:48 at FL317. The aircraft was then observed flying in an easterly direction for a period of approximately 4 minutes when again it entered into a right-hand turn at 10:52 at FL321 and a speed of 290 knots. From the radar footage this orbit was observed to be very tight, as the aircraft was observed to have completed the 360° turn at 10:53 at an altitude of FL335 and a speed of 446 knots. The last time the accident aircraft was observed on radar was at 10:55 when it was at an altitude of 12300 feet, a speed of 396 knots and a heading of 008°.At 10:55 the aircraft was intercepted by a Saab Gripen supersonic military jet from the South African Air Force (SAAF), which had been dispatched from Air Force Base Overberg. The Gripen pilot could not get close enough to the aircraft to observe whether the pilot of ZS-DKS was conscious or not. The Eclipse jet spiralled towards the ground in a left wing low attitude until it impacted the terrain. Shortly after the aircraft had departed Lanseria, the pilot's wife was contacted by SMS about the bags. It appeared she was not aware why the bags were left at Lanseria for her and stated she had no plans of going there. The investigators reported that it was not uncommon for the pilot to drop of bags during his company travels like this, but in this case it remained unexplained why he took a detour to Lanseria to drop of the bags."
2100,ACC2074,"Wasaya Airways flight 127 was to be the first of three cargo trips in the Cessna 208B Caravan (registration C-FKDL) planned from Pickle Lake Airport, Ontario, Canada to Angling Lake/Wapekeka Airport, Ontario. The first flight was planned to depart at 09:00.The pilot went to the Wasaya apron and conducted a pre-flight inspection of C-FKDL while a ground crew was loading cargo. The pilot returned to the hangar and received a briefing from the station manager regarding the planned flights. The pilot was advised that the first officer assigned to the flight had been reassigned to other duties in order to increase the aircraft's available payload and load a snowmobile on board.The pilot completed and signed a Wasaya flight dispatch clearance (FDC) form for WSG127, and filed a copy of it, along with the flight cargo manifests, in the designated location in the company operations room. The FDC for WSG127 showed that the flight was planned to be conducted under visual flight rules (VFR), under company flight-following, at an altitude of 5500 feet above sea level (ASL). Time en route was calculated to be 66 minutes, with fuel consumption of 413 pounds.The pilot returned to the aircraft on the apron. Loading and fueling were complete, and the pilot conducted a final walk-around inspection of C-FKDL. Before entering the cockpit, the pilot conducted an inspection of the upper wing surface.At 08:54, the pilot started the engine of C-FKDL and conducted ground checks for several minutes. At 08:58, the pilot advised on the mandatory frequency that WSG127 was taxiing for departure from runway 09.WSG127 departed from runway 09 at 09:00, and, at 09:01, the pilot reported on the  mandatory frequency that the flight was airborne. The flight climbed eastward for several miles and then turned left toward the track to  mandatory frequency. At about 3000 feet ASL, WSG127 briefly descended about 100 feet over 10 seconds, and then resumed climbing. At 09:05, the pilot reported that WSG127 was clear of the mandatory frequency zone.WSG127 intercepted the track to Angling Lake and climbed northward until the flight reached a peak altitude of about 4600 feet ASL at 09:08:41, and then began descending at 09:08:46. At 09:09:16, the flight made a sharp right turn of about 120° as it descended through about 4000 feet ASL. At 09:09:39, the descent ended at about 2800 feet and the aircraft climbed to about 3000 feet ASL before again beginning to descend.

2104,ACC2078,"A Cessna 525 CitationJet CJ1 was destroyed following a loss of control, an airframe in-flight breakup and impact with a snow covered field near Cedar Fort, Utah. Both occupants died in the accident.Instrument meteorological conditions prevailed in the area, and an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan was filed for the personal cross-country flight from Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah, about 09:50, with an intended destination of Tucson International Airport, Arizona.The pilot contacted the SLC departure controller at 0951:59 and reported that he was climbing through 7,500 ft mean sea level (msl) for 10,000 ft. The controller then cleared the pilot to climb to and maintain Flight Level 230 (FL230), and to delete speed restrictions; the pilot confirmed the clearance. At 0952:21, the controller instructed the pilot to maintain 14,000 ft, to delete all speed restrictions, and asked him what speed he was climbing at; the pilot confirmed the clearance and stated that he was climbing at 200 knots (kts).At 0955:01, while approaching 14,000 ft the pilot reported that he had a failure with his Flight Management System (FMS), that he was ""switching to NAV for a second,"" and would be exceeding the assigned altitude. This was followed by an unintelligible transmission. At 0955:16, the controller instructed the pilot to descend and maintain 14,000 ft and to fly his present heading. About 10 seconds later, the pilot advised the controller that he had an autopilot failure, and requested a climb to visual meteorological conditions. The controller instructed the pilot to climb and maintain FL180. At 0955:47, the pilot responded by confirming the climb to FL180. The controller then asked the pilot if he needed assistance. The pilot did not immediately respond, and the controller asked him a second time. At 0956:16, the pilot responded ""negative,"" saying that he was ""just trying to get to clear skies,"" and was climbing to FL180. The pilot stated that his ""number 2"" was working, and that his ""altitude"" had failed. The pilot concluded the transmission by saying, ""...so, uh, my number two is working, climbing to one eight thousand.""At 0956:32, the controller advised the pilot that traffic would be crossing above him at FL190, and that it was important that he level the airplane at FL180; the pilot replied, ""We'll be watching."" At 0956:45, the controller advised the pilot of two areas of light precipitation directly ahead of the airplane, and asked the pilot if he would need vectors to clear the weather. At 0956:59, the pilot responded that he would appreciate any vectors possible. Shortly thereafter, at 0957:06, the controller asked the pilot to ""...paint a picture for me of where you think the clearest skies would be. I can vector you wherever you need to go."" At 0957:12, the pilot replied that he was heading to TUS, his altitude would not hold, and that he was hand flying the airplane. About this time, radar showed the airplane beginning a right turn from its previously-established southerly heading to a southwesterly heading, though the airplane had neither been cleared to do so by the controller nor had the pilot informed the controller of the deviation. About 0957:20, the pilot transmitted that he would appreciate any vectors possible. About 15 seconds later, the controller advised the pilot that he was showing him at 17,500 ft, directed the pilot to fly his present heading, and stated that the airplane would be clear of the precipitation in about 4 miles. About 17 seconds later, the pilot transmitted, ""...ok, MAYDAY. I do need to get up higher. I am losing different instruments. I'd really like to get clear of weather."" At 0958:01, the controller issued the pilot a clearance to climb and maintain FL230, which the pilot confirmed. About 0958:26, the controller amended the previous clearance and instructed the pilot to climb to and maintain FL310, which the pilot initially confirmed, but shortly thereafter stated, ""...yeah. I can't even dial that in. Still climbing, passing twenty thousand, so I'm just going to be reading it out to be sure my second is operating correctly.""At 0958:46, the controller stated that he was showing the airplane climbing through 20,200 ft, and asked the pilot if he wanted to continue to TUS; the pilot replied, ""That is affirmative."" At 0958:53, when the airplane was at 20,700 ft, the controller issued the pilot a no-gyro turn to the left for vectors to the southeast; this occurred about 1 minute 41 seconds after the airplane had turned southwest. Radar data showed that the pilot initiated a right turn from a southwesterly heading at an altitude of 20,700 ft. At 0959:12, the airplane reached an altitude of 21,300 ft. msl, and was still in the right turn. At 0959:13, the controller stated, ""November one bravo x-ray. I show you in a right turn. Can you turn left?"" At 0959:17, while climbing out of 21,300 ft, the pilot replied that he was ""trying to climb.""About 0959:47, the controller advised the pilot that he had lost the airplane's altitude readout, and asked the pilot the airplane's altitude. There were no further transmissions received from the pilot. Between 0959:49 and 0959:58, the airplane descended from an altitude of 21,300 ft to 16,000 ft, with its rate of descent during this time increasing from 9,600 ft per minute (fpm) to 36,000 fpm.The airplane's wreckage was located in open, flat pasture ground, about 1 nautical mile southwest of Cedar Fort, Utah, and about 28 nm south-southwest of SLC. A survey of the accident site revealed that the linear debris path of wreckage extended for about 1 nm on a west to east orientation."

2107,ACC2081,"A Viking Air DHC-6 Twin Otter 400, operating Tara Air flight 193, was destroyed in an accident in the Myagdi district, Nepal. All 23 on board suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft departed at 07:50 hours local time from Pokhara Airport (PKR) on a domestic 20-minute flight to Jomsom Airport (JMO), Nepal. The copilot acted as Pilot Flying, the captain as Pilot Monitoring during the flight. En route the flight deviated to the left and climbed to 12000 feet to avoid clouds. Over the Ghorepani area the GPWS began to sound. The aircraft was flying through clouds with a little visibility in between and a descent to 10000 feet was initiated. At 10200 feet the GPWS sounded again but the captain responded not to worry about it.The captain was used to hearing these warnings in normal flight, so it became a habit to disregard the warnings. About one minute before the accident the captain took over control and initiated a climb. The aircraft impacted a mountainside at 10700 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 10982 feet.According to a statement by the airline, the aircraft crashed near Tirkhe Dungha, Dana VDC of Myagdi district."
2109,ACC2083,"An Antonov 26 cargo plane, operated by True Aviation, crashed in shallow waters of the Bay of Bengal shortly after takeoff from Cox's Bazar Airport (CXB), Bangladesh. Three Ukrainian crew members died in the crash and another was critically injured. The aircraft operated a scheduled cargo flight from Cox's Bazar to Jessore in Bangladesh. The on board cargo consisted of 802 boxes of shrimp weighing 4800 kg.The flight crew requested startup clearance at 02:58 UTC. The aircraft was then cleared to taxi to runway 35 via taxiway S. Takeoff clearance was given 03:05 UTC. During takeoff a drop in oil pressure in the torque meter system of engine no.1 caused the engine to lose power the cruise mode. The captain decided to continue takeoff. Immediately after becoming airborne the pilot reported an engine failure and requested for immediate return back to Cox's Bazar Airport. He was advised by ATC to report left hand down wind. Within 60 seconds after takeoff the no. 1 lost power completely.The captain initially tried to maneuver the aircraft to land on runway 17 (departure runway, opposite direction), but was unable to line up with the runway.The crew decided to continue on a right hand downwind at around 1000 feet with a IAS of 300km/h in clean configuration. The aircraft turned to final and fully configured for landing and stable at around 3.5 NM from the runway. But at 1.2 NM for reasons unknown the captain decided to go around and climbed to 400-500 feet. ATC advised the captain to report left hand down wind. But there was no response from the crew. The aircraft had impacted the shallow waters on the coast, 3 km West of the airport."
2111,ACC2085,"A Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operated by flydubai as Flight FZ981 from Dubai, impacted airport terrain during a second approach attempt in bad weather to Rostov-On-Don Airport in Southern Russia. The airplane was destroyed and the 55 passengers and 7 crew fatally injured.Flight 981 departed Dubai at 18:37 hours UTC on March 18. The en route part of the flight was normal. The flight arrived near Rostov and the crew performed a manual approach to runway 22 with the autopilot disconnected. Weather conditions were poor with a cloud base at 630 meters, wind 230 degrees at 13 meters per second, maximum 18 meters per second, light rain shower, mist, severe turbulence and moderate windshear.At 22:42 UTC (01:42 local time) in the course of the initial approach at a height of 340 meters (1115 feet), the flight received a windshear alert. The flight crew decided to go around and then continued to a holding pattern waiting for improved weather conditions.The flight left the holding pattern at 00:28 UTC (03:28 LT) and descended towards Rostov for another approach to runway 22. As the crew were proceeding with another manual approach, they decided to go around again at a height of 220 meters (721 feet), 4,5 km before the runway after receiving another windshear alert. They initiated a climb with a vertical speed of up to 20 m/s and setting the engines to maximum takeoff/go-around (TOGA) thrust.In the course of the go-around the crew set flaps to 15° and retracted the landing gear.At the height of 1900 ft (approx. 600 m) after reaching the pitch angle of 18° the pilot flying pushed on the control column, which led to a decrease in vertical acceleration of up to 0.5, increase in forward speed and, consequently, automatic retraction of flaps from 15° to 10° at a speed of over 200 knots.The short-term decrease in engine thrust within 3 seconds resulted in decreasing speed and flaps extension to 15°, although the following crew inputs to regain maximum takeoff/go-around thrust led to speed increase and reiterated automatic flaps retraction to 10°. The flaps remained in the latter configuration until the impact.The pilot flying, by pulling up the control column, continued climbing with a vertical speed of as much as 16 m/s.At a height of 900 m there was a simultaneous control column nose down input and stabilizer nose down deflection from -2,5 deg (6,5 units) to +2,5 deg (1,5 units). The FDR recorded a nose down stabilizer input from the stabilizer trim switch of the control wheel lasting 12 seconds, while the CVR record contains a specific noise of rotation of the trim wheels located on both sides of the central pedestal. As a result the aircraft, having climbed to about 1000 m, turned into descent with a negative vertical acceleration of -1g. The following crew recovery actions did not allow to avoid an impact with the ground.The aircraft hit the runway about 120 m from the threshold with a speed of over 600 km/h and over 50 degrees nose down pitch.

2116,ACC2090,"A BN-2T Islander aircraft impacted terrain short of the runway at Kiunga Airport in Papua New Guinea, killing all 12 persons on board.The aircraft took off from Tekin Airport at 13:56 hours local time on a VFR flight to Kiunga. On board were the pilot-in-command and 11 passengers: eight adults and three infants. In addition to the passengers and their baggage, the aircraft was carrying a significant quantity of vegetables. The weather at Kiunga was reported to be fine. As the aircraft entered the Kiunga circuit area, the pilot cancelled SARWATCH with Air Traffic Services (ATS). The pilot did not report an emergency to indicate a safety concern. Witnesses reported that during its final approach, the aircraft suddenly pitched up almost to the vertical, the right wing dropped, and the aircraft rolled inverted and rapidly ""fell to the ground"". It impacted the terrain about 1,200 metres west of the threshold of runway 07. The impact was vertical, with almost no forward motion. The aircraft was destroyed, and all occupants were fatally injured.The investigation found that the right-wing fuel tank was empty. There was no evidence of pre- or postimpact fuel leakage. The backing plate behind the fuel selectors was bent during the impact, and had jammed the left selector in its selected position. It appeared that the pilot may have been cross feeding fuel from the left-wing tank to feed the right engine.The aircraft had been reweighed 5 months prior to the accident. The operator had not sought to obtain CASA approval of the new weight and balance data sheet for inclusion in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM). There was no evidence that the pilot had computed load distribution within the aircraft. The investigation determined that while the aircraft was within the weight limitations, the load distribution placed it in a significantly aft centre of gravity (c of g) situation for takeoff and landing. The investigation determined that the right engine had failed, probably subsequent to the SARWATCH broadcast, but sufficiently before the aircraft pitched nose up, in order for the pilot to have had time to wind in full nose-left rudder trim to counteract the aerodynamic forces imposed by the failure of the right engine."
2121,ACC2095,"An Antonov An-12B cargo plane, operated by Silk Way Airlines, overran the runway during takeoff from Dwyer Airport, Afghanistan, and burst into flames. Seven of the nine occupants suffered fatal injuries.The crew planned to fly from Baku (Azerbaijan) to Bagram (Afghanistan), Dwyer (Afghanistan), Mary (Turkmenistan) and then back to Baku. The flight legs to Dwyer Airport were uneventful. At 13:11 the crew started the engines on the apron at Dwyer Airport. Engine no.2 was the last to be started up at 13:47 hours.Before the takeoff the captain distributed the duties within the crew, nominating the first officer as the Pilot Flying, and himself as Pilot Monitoring.After the engine startup the crew initiated taxiing to perform takeoff on runway 23. The concrete runway at Dwyer measured 2439 m by 37 m. In the course of the takeoff preparations, at 13:57:56 the flight mechanic reported an increase in MGT of engine no.3 above the acceptable level: ""Engine 3, look, engine temperature over six hundred, over seven hundred"", which was confirmed by the first officer: ""Yes, its getting temperature"" while the captain asked to be more attentive.The takeoff was performed with Flaps 15. As the checklist was being read, the captain ordered to lock the propellers. After the captain's order to lock the propellers a slight increase in torque values was recorded on engine no.1 and 4, and in 17 seconds also engine no.2. There was no evidence that the propeller of engine no.3 was locked.At 13:59:42 the crew initiated the takeoff. Before the takeoff the ATC advised the crew on the wind direction and speed on the runway: 280° 14 knots (7 m/sec) gusting 26 knots (13 m/sec). Thus it was quartering headwind and the headwind component might have been 5 to 9 m/sec.While performing takeoff the crew first increased thrust on engines no.1 and no.4 and then on engine no.2 after 10 seconds. The thrust of the three engines was about 50 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (lower than takeoff mode). The third engine was still operating in the ground idle mode, though the CVR did not record any crew callouts concerning engine no.3 operation parameters.Based on the CCTV system of Dwyer Airport the takeoff roll was initiated almost from the runway threshold and was conducted to the left of the runway centerline. No significant deviations from the takeoff course during the takeoff roll were recorded. During the takeoff roll the rudder was deflected left close to extreme. Probably the pilots were also applying differential control on engine no.2 to decrease the right torque moment.At 14:00:14 at approximately 120 km/h IAS the ""Engine no.3 negative thrust"" signal started. At that time the aircraft was about 430 m away from the start of the takeoff roll.At 14:00:42 engines no.1 and no.4 thrust was increased up to 63 kg/sq.cm as per torque indicator (consistent with takeoff mode for the actual flight conditions). At that time the IAS was about 150 km/h. Engine no.2 thrust was increased up to the same value only 23 seconds later at about 200 km/h IAS. At that time the aircraft was about 840 m away from the runway end. Engine no.3 was still operating in ground idle mode. Approximately 260 m before the runway end at a speed of 220 km/h IAS (maximum speed reached) nose up input on the control column was started. The aircraft did not lift off. After rolling all along the runway the aircraft overran the runway onto the ground at a speed of 220 km/h.While moving on the ground the aircraft sustained significant damage, which led to a post-crash fire that destroyed most of the aircraft structures. Out of the nine persons on board seven were killed and two were seriously injured and taken to hospital."
2126,ACC2100,"The Antonov 2 biplane was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Novopokrovskoye, Russia during an aerial application flight. Both occupants were killed.The aircraft was contracted to carry out agricultural operations starting at the end of April 2016. A captain, co-pilot and technician were assigned to the aircaft. On June 20, 2016 the co-pilot left the crew without explanation of the reasons. This posed a problem for the captain, as agricultural flights may only be carried by two pilots. In violation of this, the captain started carrying out flights on his own. On June 29, an acquaintance of the pilot and a former AN-2 pilot, flew along. On June 29 and June 30 eyewitnesses noticed that both men were consuming alcoholic beverages between flights.The accident happened on the fifth flight of the day.  The aircraft impacted terrain during a turn. A fire developed, which consumed the aircraft.It was established that turns were executed at bank angles of about 40°, which exceeded the allowed 30°. Furthermore, the flight was executed at altitudes of 20-40 m where the limit was 50 m."
2127,ACC2101,"An Ilyushin 76 firefighting aircraft was destroyed when it impacted wooded terrain 9 km east-southeast from the settlement of Rybnyi Uyan in the Kachug Region, on the side of a volcanic cone. The Il-76 transport plane was equipped with spray tanks to extinguish wildfires in the Bayanday district of the Irkutsk region. It departed Irkutsk Airport at 10:19 hours and climbed to FL100. En route the pressure was set at 1007 hPa, which had been reported by the air traffic controller. About 11:02 hours the flight crew initiated their descent towards the forest fires. After carrying out a 180 degree turn over a mountainous area, the Ground Proximity Warning System activated several times. The aircraft was flying at a height of about 210 m agl and headed towards one of the higher mountains in the area. At 11:13 the aircraft impacted the wooded slope of the mountain and disintegrated.Searchers located the wreckage on July 3."
237,ACC211,"The aircraft was one of a number of aircraft of this type used for the carriage of company employees and goods for Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH.A twice-weekly charter service was operated from Germany to Warton Aerodrome in the United Kingdom or, alternatively, to Blackpool civil airport.D-CASY left Munich on the morning of 29 June 1972 and landed at 09:04 hrs at Blackpool, as Customs facilities were not available at that time at Warton.During the day the aircraft remained on the ground at Blackpool and for most of the time the captain and co-pilot were with it. At 15:20 hrs six of the eight passengers to be carried on the return trip to Germany arrived at Blackpool Airport and, as it was raining, sat in the aircraft, the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) of which was running. Two more passengers were expected. A flight plan was prepared for Munich via Rotterdam and filed at 15:30 hrs.The two passengers did not turn up at the appointed time and the APU was shut down while the passengers and crew waited in the aircraft. About 16:30 hrs word was received that the two extra passengers were not coming. This meant that extra fuel could be accommodated and a new flight plan direct to Munich could be prepared. It was filed by the first officer, while the captain carried out the pre-flight check. The captain then started the APU and sat in the left hand seat with the first officer in the right hand seat and, according to the passenger who survived the accident, indicated that the first officer should operate the aircraft in command under supervision.The aircraft taxied out and lined up and the surviving passenger saw the right hand wing slat extended when the first officer applied power with the brakes 'on' at the start of the take-off. The port side wing slat and the flaps were outside this passenger's field of view.During the take-off run the aircraft reached its normal rotation speed in the usual distance. However, although the aircraft was travelling fast enough, rotation did not take place and it did not become airborne. The surviving passenger saw the first officer's hand holding the throttles fully open and wondered why the aircraft did not take-off. Then he saw a gesture from the captain indicating that the take-off should be abandoned. The first officer immediately closed the throttles. Observers on the aerodrome heard the engine noise die down approximately 300 metres from the end of the runway. Subsequently brake marks were found commencing in the same area. Braking was not effective, however, and the aircraft left the end of the runway at high speed, in a level attitude with its nosewheel and main wheels in contact with the ground. Shortly before the first impact the surviving passenger noticed the captain's hand on the controls and saw aileron movement.The first collision occurred when the starboard wing tip struck and severed a post supporting one of the airfield runway approach lights. The aircraft continued, colliding with and badly distorting the double track railway lines at the edge of the airfield. The nose wheel of the landing gear was broken off by this impact and some structural damage was done to the underside of the fuselage. Almost immediately beyond the railway lines the aircraft broke through a wall and collided with a row of single storey masonry chalets in the adjacent holiday camp, demolishing six of them and setting them on fire.The wings were broken off during this impact, spilling fuel over the area, but the main part of the aircraft continued its progress, sustaining further structural damage as it did so. The forward part of the fuselage, including the flight deck, was twisted to starboard and progressively destroyed. The final impact brought the aircraft to rest against a second row of chalets which were also badly damaged. The wreckage caught fire and was destroyed. The crew of two and five of the six passengers on board were killed. The sixth passenger, although thrown clear, was seriously injured."
2142,ACC2116,"A Cessna 500 Citation I jet, registration C-GTNG, impacted terrain shortly after takeoff from Kelowna Airport, Canada. All four occupants died in the crash.The aircraft arrived at Kelowna Airport at about 08:30 in the morning from Calgary/Springbank Airport. That evening the flight was to fly back to Springbank with the pilot and 3 passengers.The pilot filed an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight plan via the MENBO and IGVEP waypoints to Calgary/Springbank, and the flight was expected to take 46 minutes at a cruise altitude of FL250.At 21:26, the pilot obtained an IFR clearance from the ground controller for the KELOWNA SEVEN DEP standard instrument departure (SID) procedure for runway 34.The instructions for the Runway 34 KELOWNA SEVEN DEP SID were to climb to 9000 feet ASL, or to an altitude assigned by air traffic control (ATC), and to contact the Vancouver Area Control Centre (ACC) after passing through 4000 feet ASL. The aircraft was then to climb and track 330° magnetic (M) inbound to the Kelowna non-directional beacon (LW). From LW, the aircraft was to climb and track 330°M outbound for vectors to the filed or assigned route.At 21:31, the Kelowna tower controller cleared the aircraft to take off from the intersection of runway 34 and taxiway D. The pilot acknowledged the clearance and began the take-off roll on runway 34 about 1 minute later. Radar data showed that, at 21:33:41, the aircraft was 0.5 nautical miles (nm) beyond the departure end of the runway and was climbing at more than 4000 feet per minute (fpm) through 2800 feet ASL, at a climb angle of approximately 16°. In that time, it had deviated laterally by about 3° to the right of the 330°M track associated with the SID.At 21:34:01, when the aircraft was 1.2 nm beyond the runway, it had climbed through 3800 feet ASL and deviated further to the right of the intended routing. The aircraft's rate of climb decreased to about 1600 fpm, and its ground speed was 150 knots. A short time later, the aircraft's rate of climb decreased to 600 fpm, its climb angle decreased to 2°, and its ground speed had increased to 160 knots.At 21:34:22, the aircraft was 2.1 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, and it was climbing through approximately 4800 feet ASL. The aircraft had deviated about 13° to the right of the intended track, and its rate of climb reached its maximum value of approximately 6000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 22°. The ground speed was roughly 145 knots.At 21:34:39, the aircraft was 2.7 nm beyond the departure end of the runway, passing through 5800 feet ASL, and had deviated about 20° to the right of the intended routing. The rate of climb was approximately 2000 fpm, with a climb angle of about 7°.According to the SID, the pilot was to make initial contact with the ACC after the aircraft had passed through 4000 feet ASL. Initial contact was made when the aircraft was passing through 6000 feet ASL, at 21:34:42.ACC acknowledged the communication and indicated that the aircraft had been identified on radar. The aircraft was then cleared for a right turn direct to the MENBO waypoint once it was at a safe altitude, or once it was climbing through 8000 feet ASL. The aircraft was also cleared to follow the flight-planned route and climb to 10 000 feet ASL.At 21:34:55, the pilot read back the clearance as the aircraft climbed through 6400 feet ASL, with a rate of climb of approximately 2400 fpm. The aircraft was tracking about 348°M at a groundspeed of about 170 knots.At 21:35:34, the aircraft began a turn to the right, which was consistent with the instruction from the ACC. Flying directly to the MENBO waypoint required the aircraft to be on a heading of 066°M, requiring a right turn of about 50°. At this point, the aircraft was still climbing and was passing through 8300 feet ASL. The rate of climb was about 3000 fpm.The aircraft continued the right turn and was tracking through 085°M. After reaching a peak altitude of approximately 8600 feet ASL, the aircraft entered a steep descending turn to the right, consistent with the characteristics of a spiral dive.At 21:35:47, the ACC controller cleared C-GTNG to climb to FL 250. The lack of radar returns and radio communications from the aircraft prompted the controller to initiate search activities.At 21:51, NAV CANADA notified first responders, who located the accident site in forested terrain at about midnight. The aircraft had been destroyed, and all of the occupants had been fatally injured.Because there were no flight recording systems on board the aircraft, the TSB could not determine the cause of the accident. The most plausible scenario is that the pilot, who was likely dealing with a high workload associated with flying the aircraft alone, experienced spatial disorientation and departed from controlled flight shortly after takeoff. The investigation also determined that the pilot did not have the recent night flying experience required by Transport Canada for carrying passengers at night."
2143,ACC2117,"A Cessna 208, N208KM, was substantially damaged during a skydiving event over Marion County Airport (X35), Dunnellon, Florida. One of the 10 skydivers on board was fatally injured, and the commercial pilot and the other 9 skydivers were not injured. The airplane was registered to a private individual and operated by the National Parachute Test Center.The flight departed and climbed to an altitude of 1,250 ft above ground level. The first three skydivers exited the airplane uneventfully, and the fourth moved into position. The training advisor observed that the fourth skydiver seemed to hesitate, and the jumpmaster leaned forward toward him. As the fourth jumper exited the airplane, the training advisor noticed a flash of white and watched as the jumpmaster's reserve parachute deployed and entered the airplane's slipstream. The jumpmaster attempted to pull the parachute back into the airplane and was pulled into the door frame before being dragged out of the airplane. Observers on the ground watched as the jumpmaster descended beneath his streaming (unopened) reserve parachute to the ground. The ground observers reported that the jumpmaster made no movements, appeared to be unconscious, and did not deploy his main parachute. The pilot reported that he was able to maintain control of the airplane and land without further incident.Examination of the airplane by a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) inspector revealed that the cargo door frame and fuselage were buckled."
2155,ACC2129,"A Grumman G-73 Mallard amphibian was destroyed when it impacted the water of Swan River in Perth, Australia. The pilot and his passenger suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft was flying a display during the City of Perth Australia Day Skyworks 2017 event. It departed Serpentine Airport at 16:28 and proceeded along the coast towards Perth. A holding pattern was flown to the east of Garden Island at an altitude of approximately 1600 feet, waiting to fly a display. At 16:50 it continued flying north towards Perth in company with a Cessna Caravan amphibian.Both aircraft conducted a series of circuits that included low-level fly-pasts of the Langley Park foreshore. After the second fly-past, the pilot of VH-CQA commenced a third circuit, while the Caravan departed the area.As part of the third circuit, the pilot of the Mallard flew in an easterly direction, parallel with the South Perth foreshore, before commencing a left turn. This would have facilitated a third pass in a westerly direction along the Langley Park foreshore. During the left turn, the aircraft rolled left and pitched nose down, consistent with an aerodynamic stall. The aircraft collided with the water and broke up. The pilot and passenger were fatally injured."
2162,ACC2136,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A-3 Islander aircraft was damaged beyond repair after impacting Vumba Mountain near Mutare, Zimbabwe. All six on board suffered fatal injuries.According to a communiqué from the Civil Aviation Institute of Mozambique, the passengers were staff all from Cornelder de Mozambique, which operates terminals in the Port of Beira.Information from the Civil Aviation Institute of Mozambique indicates that the aircraft hit the Vumba Mountain in Manica due to bad weather and subsequently crashed in the Mutare area."
2167,ACC2141,"The Cessna 208 aircraft registered PK-FSO, was being operated on an unscheduled cargo flight from Tanahmerah Airport to Oksibil Airport in Papua, Indonesia. On board the aircraft was one pilot, 1,225 kg of general cargo and 800 lbs of fuel.At 11:44 hours local time, in daylight conditions, the aircraft departed Tanahmerah and cruised at altitude of 7,000 feet. Estimate time arrival at Oksibil would be 12:24.At 12:12, when the aircraft position was about 45 NM north of Tanahmerah, the aircraft passed another Cessna 208B aircraft from the opposite direction from Oksibil to Tanahmerah. The Cessna 208B pilot advised to the pilot via radio that the PK-FSO aircraft was in sight. The pilot responded that the aircraft was maintaining 7,000 feet on direct route to Oksibil.The pilot failed to contact the Oksibil air traffic controller and failed to arrive at the destination. The airline's flight following officer received an emergency signal with a last recorded position of 6 NM north of Oksibil. The next day the aircraft was found on a ridge of Anem Mountain at a height of 7100 feet. The aircraft was destroyed by impact forces and the pilot was fatally injured.The investigation learned that two days prior the occurrence, the pilot travelled on a night commercial flight. This might have resulted in a sleep disturbance during the window of circadian low and an increase of the potential of fatigue. There are indications that the pilot did not have the required adequate restorative sleep before he started flying on the accident day. Prior to the occurrence flight, the pilot had flown for 3 flight sectors, with total flight hour of 2 hours 55 minutes. The multiple take-offs and landings that day increased fatigue. Based on the final flight track, the absence of voice communication, the weather condition permitting the pilot to identify the airport location and the aircraft wreckage, consistently indicated that there were no pilot activities to fly the aircraft after the last known pilot activities at about 29 Nm from Oksibil until impact.Colleagues of the pilot reported that he often smoked in the cockpit during the flight, looked sleepy and engaged the Terrain Inhibit switch which disabled the GA-EGPWS function while flying. This prevented any prior warning when the aircraft neared Anem Mountain.This known behavior was not reported to the Operation and Safety department, so no action could be taken."
2172,ACC2146,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan airplane, N803TH, sustained substantial damage after impacting steep, mountainous terrain about 8 miles south of Chignik Lake Airport, Alaska. The airplane was being operated as Flight 341 by Grant Aviation as a scheduled commuter flight. The pilot, the sole occupant, sustained fatal injuries.

They decided to return to the departure aerodrome. During descent, the engine began running rough. Sparks and flames were observed. When approaching the airstrip at Ekimchan, the engine began losing power. At an altitude of about 50 meters, the engine stopped. Because of the presence of buildings in front of the aircraft, the crew executed the turn to the left. The aircraft impacted a wooded area, near the end of the runway."
2207,ACC2181,"A Let L-410 aircraft operated by Khabarovsk Avia impacted a forest with little or no forward speed, 1200 m short of runway 04 at Nelkan Airport, Russia. Two crew members and four passengers suffered fatal injuries. A young girl was the only survivor. There was no fire.The aircraft operated on a domestic flight from Khabarovsk to Nikolayevsk-na-Amure and Nelkan. However, due to runway works at Nikolayevsk-na-Amure, it was decided to stop at Chumikan instead.At 12:35 the crew radioed the Nelkan Tower controller and received the approach and landing conditions and the landing site actual weather. The approach to landing was conducted to runway 04 with the standalone NDB using the right-hand landing pattern.The approach was conducted with flaps at 18° and the landing gear in the down position. After the crew started to perform the final approach, they reported the readiness for landing and received the respective clearance from the controller. The PIC acted as Pilot Flying. In the course of the final approach, at distance of about 5 km and at height of 400 m, the autopilot was disengaged, and the PIC having the runway in sight decided to continue the landing.After the autopilot disengagement, both Power Control Levers (PCLs) were set to the fine pitch mode; then the crew performed the landing checklist. The final approach was conducted within the speed range of 100 to 115 KIAS. The crew then set the PCLs to the fine pitch mode.The abnormal situation started to develop at 13:10:38 at height of approximately 170 m, when the speed was 108 kts. With the pedals' position remained unchanged and with zero roll, the magnetic heading was changed by 10° (to the right) within 5 seconds, then at 13:10:44 when both thrust control levers (TCLs) were set to forward thrust, the no.2 engine entered the BETA RANGE. A right roll started to develop, and after 4 to 5 s it reached about 20-25°. The crew tried to arrest the roll, but the aircraft began to descend and quickly lost speed.The crew's control actions aimed to recover the aircraft by applying the TCL of the no.1 engine, as well as the controls for the ailerons, elevators and rudder, failed. The crew did not feather the no.2 propeller and the no.2 engine continued to operate.At 13:10:53 at the height of 100 m, with a speed of 76 kts, the stall warning sounded. The aircraft started to develop an aggressive right roll and performed a full-circle rotation around its longitudinal axis (barrel-roll).The aircraft then impacted terrain.The investigation revealed that the no.2 engine propeller blades uncommanded turned to an angle of -1.8°, which was significantly below the minimum inflight pitch angle of 13.5°. During certification of the Let L-410 aircraft, the probability of a propeller uncommanded setting into the BETA range was considered to be 10-14."

At 17:59, northwest of Stuttgart, Langen Center instructed the flight to descend from FL210 to FL170, followed by a further descent instruction to FL150. At 18:03 the crew was instructed to change frequency to Swiss Radar. The controller of Swiss Radar instructed the crew to continue to descend to FL110. At 18:05 the crew contacted Zurich Arrival and were told to expect a runway 24 ILS approach to Friedrichshafen. Further descent instructions were given to FL90, 6000 feet, and 5000 feet. At 18:12 the flight was told to turn right to 150 degrees descend to 4000 feet. At 18:13 Zurich Arrival radioed: ""[...] right heading two one five, cleared for the ILS approach two four, report established.""This was confirmed by the crew and read back correctly.Subsequently, the radar controller observed that the aircraft crossed the localizer slightly at 4000 feet at a speed of approximately 240 KIAS, and began a rapid descent. The crew did not respond to repeated calls.At 18:14 the plane touched obstacles in a forest area directly west of Waldburg. It then flew at high speed, at a shallow angle, into another piece of forest about 1000 m away. The three occupants were fatally injured and the plane destroyed.A review of previous approaches to Friedrichshafen by OE-FWD showed that the localizer was intercepted at airspeeds between 220 and 240 knots.

2240,ACC2214,"A Junkers Ju-52/3m aircraft, operated by Ju-Air, was destroyed in an accident in a mountainous area in Switzerland. The aircraft crashed into the western slope of Piz Segnas at an elevation of 2540 m. All 17 passengers and three crew members were killed.The aircraft had departed Locarno, Switzerland, at 16:10 on a flight to its home base at Dübendorf.The aircraft flew on a northeasterly course into the basin southwest of Piz Segnas. Towards the north end of the basin, it began a left turn, which developed into a descending spiral trajectory. A short time later, the aircraft collided with the ground almost vertically and at high speed.Following the crash, all Swiss Junkers Ju-52 aircraft were grounded. Ju-Air was allowed to restart operations on August 17 with the two remaining aircraft of the same type. Since there were no indications of general technical defects at this time, the FOCA had approved the resumption of flight operations in compliance with precautionary measures.On November 20, the Swiss TSB published an interim report. There was still no evidence that a serious technical problem led to the accident. The investigation of the wreck, however, revealed severe structural damage in the form of cracks and corrosion on the main spar, the supporting element of the aircraft wing, and other parts of the aircraft. This damage was hidden during normal inspections and maintenance and could only be determined from the debris. Since the two Ju-52 HB-HOP and HB-HOS stationed in Dübendorf correspond in age as well as in hours of operation to the crashed aircraft, the Swiss authorities temporarily grounded both aircraft for inspections."
2250,ACC2224,"A Boeing 737-800 operated by Air Niugini as flight 73 impacted the water of Chuuk Lagoon about 1,500 ft (460 m) short of the runway 04 threshold, during its approach Chuuk International Airport, Micronesia. The aircraft took off from Pohnpei at 22:22 on a flight to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea via Chuuk. The PIC was the pilot flying for the sector to Chuuk. The copilot was the monitoring pilot. The engineer for the flight was seated in the cockpit jump seat during the approach. Prior to top of descent the crew briefly discussed brake setting for the landing and discussed the approach and landing flap setting. They agreed to select Flap 40. They then discussed the approach and missed approach procedure they would conduct at HAMAX if they found themselves not visual by that point. However, the approach and landing checklist and the briefing on the RNAV approach chart briefings were not conducted in accordance with the SOPs and not using standard phraseology. At top of descent, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were already high and needed to immediately initiate their descent. The crew commenced their descent leaving FL400 at 22:56, at a descent rate of 944 ft/pm. At FL340, the copilot contacted San Francisco radio and reported that they were maintaining FL340. Both pilots discussed the descent clearance for about two minutes, trying to recall and clarify the instructions that they were given. At 23:05, while maintaining FL340, the PIC stated to the copilot that they were high on profile and needed to descend to get back on the required descent profile. At 23:08, the PIC said ""alright, we catching back on profile, so just keep the speed up"". The copilot contacted Chuuk radio at 23:08 and requested a weather update. At 23:11, Chuuk radio contacted the crew with the weather update for Chuuk stating: ""wind variable at 5, visibility 14 scattered 012 charlie bravo, broken 120 overcast 280, temperature 26 dep point 25, altimeter 2973"". At 23:15, at about 15 nm from Chuuk while passing 8,600 ft, the copilot made an inbound broadcast call stating their intention to track for the RNAV (GPS) runway 04, from the east south-east. Five minutes later the copilot made a general broadcast, stating that they were established on 041 inbound via the RNAV (GPS) runway 04. The aircraft was then configured for the approach. At 1000 feet the aircraft was stable but above the 3 degrees glidepath. At 23:23 the PIC disconnected the auto-pilot and stated: ""Im going back on profile."" When passing 548 ft (602 ft Radio Altitude) on descent, the aircraft entered the storm cell and heavy rain and the PIC called for the wipers to be switched on. After passing the Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA), between 307 ft (364 ft RA) fourteen 'Sink Rate' and 'Glideslope' aural alerts began to sound. The flight crew disregarded the alerts, and did not acknowledge the ""minimums"" and 100 ft alerts. After descending through 100 feet the copilot noticed they were dangerously low and called rapidly with high intonation: ""Too low! Were too low! Were too low! Were too low!"" The aircraft then skipped across the water several times before it settled in the water and turned clockwise through 210 deg and drifted 460 ft (140 m) south east of the runway 04 extended centreline, with the nose of the aircraft pointing about 265 degrees. Local boaters rescued 28 passengers and two cabin crew from the left over-wing exits. Two cabin crew, the two pilots and the engineer were rescued by local boaters from the forward door 1L. One life raft was launched from the left aft over-wing exit by cabin crew CC5 with the assistance of a passenger. The US Navy divers rescued six passengers and four cabin crew and the Load Master from the right aft over-wing exit. All injured passengers were evacuated from the left over-wing exits. One passenger was fatally injured, and local divers located his body in the aircraft three days after the accident. The accident investigators concluded that both pilots were not situationally aware during the approach and did not recognise the developing significant unsafe condition after passing the Missed Approach Point (MAP) when the aircraft entered a storm cell and heavy rain. The weather radar on the PICs Navigation Display showed a large red area indicating a storm cell immediately after the MAP, between the MAP and the runway. The copilot as the monitoring pilot was ineffective and was oblivious to the rapidly unfolding unsafe situation. He did not recognise the significant unsafe condition and therefore did not realise the need to challenge the PIC and take control of the aircraft, as required by the Air Niugini SOP. Training records showed that the copilot had been checked in the simulator for EGPWS Alert (Terrain) however there was no evidence of simulator check sessions covering the vital actions and responses required to retrieve a perceived or real situation that might compromise the safe operation of the aircraft. Specifically sustained unstabilised approach below 1,000 ft amsl in IMC as in the case of the accident. The PIC did not conduct the missed approach at the MAP despite the criteria required for visually continuing the approach not being met, including visually acquiring the runway or the PAPI. The PIC did not conduct a go around after passing the MAP and subsequently the MDA although: the aircraft had entered IMC; the approach was unstable; the glideslope indicator on the Primary Flight Display (PFD) was showing a rapid glideslope deviation from a half-dot low to 2-dots high within 9 seconds after passing the MDA; the rate of descent was high (more than 1,000 ft/min) and increasing; there were EGPWS Sink Rate and Glideslope aural alerts; and the EGPWS visual PULL UP warning message was displayed on the PFD."
2256,ACC2230,"A Britten-Norman BN-2A Islander, operated by Par-Avion, impacted mountainous terrain in the Southwest National Park in Tasmania, Australia. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, died in the crash.The aircraft departed Hobart Cambridge Airport in Tasmania at 07:48 hours local time on a repositioning flight to Bathurst Harbour Airport to pick up passengers. ADS-B position and altitude data showed the aircraft tracked to the south-west towards Bathurst Harbour. At about 08:16, the aircraft approached a gap in the Arthur Range known as 'the portals'. The portals are a saddle (lowest area) between the Eastern and Western Arthur Range, and was an optional route that the airline used between Cambridge and Bathurst Harbour when the cloud base prevented flight over the mountain range. After passing through the portals, the aircraft proceeded to conduct a number of turns below the height of the surrounding highest terrain. The final data point recorded was at about 08:28."
2261,ACC2235,"The Air Tindi Beechcraft 200 King Air aircraft departed controlled flight during its initial descent and crashed near Whatì, Northwest Territories, Canada. Both pilots were killed.The aircraft operated flight 503, an instrument flight rules flight itinerary from Yellowknife to Whatì Airport, Wekweètì Airport, and Ekati Aerodrome. During the flight preparations at Yellowknife the first officer (FO) noted that the right-side vacuum-driven attitude indicator was not erect. The captain assured the FO that the instrument would start to operate. The flight took off from Yellowknife at 08:51.During the climb, while working the after-takeoff checklist, it appeared that the right-side ADI still wasn't working. The captain suggested to the FO that he should tap the attitude indicator to see if it was stuck or frozen. The FO replied that the attitude indicator was still not erect.While en route at FL120 the pilots attempted to troubleshoot the right-side attitude indicator, but to avail. At 09:11, after having commenced the descent, the captains attitude indicator on the left-side instrument panel displayed a red ""GYRO"" flag and the autopilot disconnected. At this time the captain began to manually fly the aircraft with partial flight instruments. The aircraft continued to descend, and the captain attempted to initiate a climb. The aircraft climbed briefly before beginning to descend again. The aircraft subsequently entered a gradual left turn that progressed into a steep descending left turn (spiral) from which the aircraft never recovered.The investigation established that both the captain and the FO had an iPad mini equipped with the ForeFlight Mobile application which had the capability to provide a backup attitude indication and synthetic vision view to both pilots. Since it was a backup feature, Air Tindi did not have a formal training program in place for using the attitude and heading reference system (AHRS) feature of ForeFlight."

2270,ACC2244,"A float-equipped DHC-3 Turbine Otter (N959PA of Taquan Air) and a float-equipped DHC-2 Beaver (N952DB of Mountain Air Service) collided in midair, about 7 miles northeast of Ketchikan, Alaska, USA. The five occupants of the DHC-2 sustained fatal injuries. The DHC-3 pilot sustained minor injuries, nine passengers sustained serious injuries, and one passenger sustained fatal injuries. The purpose of both flights was to transport passengers to Ketchikan from the Misty Fjords National Monument area in Alaska, USA. Both flights were converging on a scenic waterfall before returning to the Ketchikan Harbor Seaplane Base.At 12:17:15, the DHC-3 was about level at 4,000 ft mean sea level (msl) on a track of 225°, and the DHC-2 was 4.2 nautical miles south of the DHC-3, climbing through 2,800 ft msl, on a track of 255°. About 12:19, the DHC-3 started a descent from 4,000 ft msl, and the DHC-2 was at 3,175 ft msl and climbing. During the next 1 minute 21 seconds, the DHC-3 continued to descend on a track between 224° and 237°, and the DHC-2 leveled out at 3,350 ft msl on a track of about 255°. The airplanes collided at 12:21:14 at an altitude of 3,350 ft msl, 7.4 nm northeast of Ketchikan Harbor.The DHC-3 pilot stated to the NTSB that the flight from the Misty Fjords area had proceeded normally, and he had descended and was maneuvering the airplane to show passengers a waterfall near Mahoney Lake when the collision occurred. Just prior to the collision, he saw a flash from his left side, and experienced a large, loud impact. According to the pilot, the DHC-3 airplane then rolled right and pitched about 40 degrees nose down toward the water in George Inlet. The pilot stated that he was able to maintain some control and flare the airplane prior to impact. The pilot, some passengers, and some bystanders helped the passengers of the DHC-3 evacuate the airplane and move to the shore. The DHC-3 main wreckage came to rest about 80 ft underwater about 400 ft off the east shore of George Inlet.The DHC-2 airplane broke up in-flight after the collision, and the wreckage was scattered over water and mountainous tree-covered terrain northeast of Mahoney Lake on the west shore of George Inlet.Both aircraft were ADS-B-equipped and both pilots were presented with visual traffic information through the iPad with ForeFlight app (DHC-2) and Chelton display (DHC-3). However, the Garmin GSL 71 on the DHC-3 had been turned off, causing pressure altitude of the airplane not to be transmitted with the ADS-B data. Thus, both systems were not able to generate warnings of potential conflicts.Additionally, the DHC-2 was obscured from the Otter pilot's vision by the window frame until the very last moment. The Beaver pilot likely was unable to see the Otter approaching from behind due to the aircraft structure and the passenger seated on his right."
251,ACC225,"The Shorts Skyvan aircraft, VH-PNI, was scheduled to carry out two return charter flights from Minj to Mendi. The flight plan showed that these were to be instrument flight rules (IFR) category flights but specified that visual flight rules (VFR) procedures would be used throughout. The first flight from Minj to Mendi, which was the one on which the accident occurred, was planned with a position report abeam Mt. Hagen 9 minutes after departure and with a further 17 minute time interval between Mt. Hagen and Mendi. The planned cruising heights on these two route sectors were8,500 and 10,000 feet respectively and the tracks were 277 degrees magnetic and 245 degrees magnetic. These tracks do not take into consideration the deviations from track which are necessary to avoid the high en route terrain; the most significant being Mount Giluwe which is 14,346 feet (4373 m) in height and lies on the direct track between Mt. Hagen and Mendi. To avoid Mt. Giluwe when operating on this route at heights below the lowest safe altitude of 16,800 feet, it is necessary for aircraft to divert to the north via the Tomba Pass or to the south via the Kuta Pass. The aircraft departed from  Minj at 10:11 hours. The was offered the choice of tracking via the Tomba or the Kuta Pass and accepted the Tomba. The pilot made the necessary position reports and passed Mt. Hagen at 10,000 feet at 10:23 hours.At 10:28 hours VH-PNI reported on the Madang frequency and two minutes later Madang passed traffic information to VH-PNI and a following aircraft. The pilot of VH-PNI acknowledged this information and amended his estimated time of arrival at Mendi to 10:38 hours.At 10:35 hours Madang passed further traffic information to a number of aircraft in the area, including VH-PNI, but there was no acknowledgement from VH-PNI and the aircraft failed to arrive at Mendi.The wreckage of the aircraft was sighted from the air on the morning of 2 September on the north-eastern slope of Mt. Giluwe, at an altitude of 10,250 feet (3124 m), close to the direct track from Mt. Hagen to Mendi. It had impacted a steep, heavily timbered slope and broke up.Over the Tomba Pass there was a strato-cumulus cloud layer between 10000 and 10300 feet and unlimited visibility above."

The first 3 flights were direct flights to the fishing lodge. Because of poor weather conditions in the central coast region, however, all of the flights were delayed.After the crews referred to weather cameras along the central coast region, the flights began to depart, but in a different order than originally scheduled. One of Seairs senior operational staff (operations manager) departed CAM9 at 08:50 aboard C-FLAC. The occurrence aircraft departed at 09:32.The pilot originally scheduled to fly C-GSAS declined the flight. This pilot had recently upgraded to the Caravan, had never flown to this destination before, and was concerned about the weather at the destination. When Seairs chief pilot returned to CAM9 at 09:53 after a series of scheduled flights on a different type of aircraft, he assumed the last remaining flight to the lodge and C-GSAS departed CAM9 at 10:24.After departing the Vancouver terminal control area, the occurrence aircraft climbed to 4500 feet above sea level (ASL) and remained at this altitude until 10:23, when a slow descent was initiated. The aircraft levelled off at approximately 1300 feet ASL at 10:44, when it was approximately 18 NM northeast of Port Hardy Airport (CYZT), BC, and 57 NM southeast of the destination.At 10:50, the occurrence aircraft slowly descended again as the flight continued northbound. During this descent, the aircrafts flaps were extended to the 10° position. At this point, the occurrence aircraft was 37 NM south-southeast of the fishing lodge. The aircraft continued to descend until it reached an altitude of approximately 330 feet ASL, at 10:56. By this point, the occurrence aircraft was being operated along the coastline, but over the ocean.C-FLAC departed from the fishing lodge at 10:56 on the return flight to CAM9. C-FLAC flew into the Fitz Hugh Sound and proceeded southbound along the western shoreline. At approximately 11:00, it flew through an area of heavy rain where visibility was reduced to about 1 statute mile (SM). C-FLAC descended to about 170 feet ASL and maintained this altitude for the next 5 minutes before climbing to about 300 feet ASL.As the southbound C-FLAC entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the north at Hecate Island, the occurrence aircraft entered Fitz Hugh Sound from the south, near the southern tip of Calvert Island. The occurrence aircraft then changed course from the western to the eastern shoreline, and descended again to about 230 feet ASL, while maintaining an airspeed of approximately 125 knots.The two aircraft established 2-way radio contact. The pilot of C-FLAC indicated that Addenbroke Island was visible when he flew past it, and described the weather conditions in the Fitz Hugh Sound to the occurrence pilot as heavy rain showers and visibility of approximately 1 SM around Kelpie Point. The occurrence pilot then indicated that he would maintain a course along the eastern shoreline of the sound.At 11:03, the two aircraft were separated by 2 NM and passed each other on reciprocal tracks, approximately 4 NM south of the accident site. The occurrence aircraft maintained a consistent track and altitude for the next 54 seconds, then slowly began a 25° change in track to the west (0.35 NM from the Addenbroke Island shoreline). Seven seconds after the turn started (0.12 NM from the islands shoreline), the aircraft entered a shallow climb averaging 665 fpm.At 11:04:55, the occurrence aircraft struck trees on Addenbroke Island at an altitude of approximately 490 feet ASL, at an airspeed of 114 knots, and in a relatively straight and level attitude. The aircraft then continued through the heavily forested hillside for approximately 450 feet, coming to rest at an elevation of 425 feet ASL, 9.7 NM east-southeast of the destination fishing lodge.The aircraft was destroyed by the impact forces and the pilot and three of the eight passengers were killed."

2283,ACC2257,"The Alkan Air Cessna 208B aircraft was scheduled to depart Mayo Airport (CYMA), Canada, to conduct 4 flights under visual flight rules (VFR). First a return flight to Rackla Airstrip, then a return flight to Rau Airstrip. The pilot completed the first two flights with no issues. The aircraft departed CYMA on the third flight at 09:54. A portion of the recorded track was along Granite Creek at an altitude of 4200 feet ASL, which put the aircraft 100 to 200 feet above ground level (AGL) at the highest point along Granite Creek. The aircraft was observed flying eastbound along Granite Creek at low altitude and in reduced visibilities due to rain and cloud at about 10:05. The aircraft arrived at Rau Airstrip at 10:17, where the cargo was unloaded and different cargo loaded. A passenger boarded the aircraft for the final flight and was seated in the right seat in the cockpit. The aircraft departed Rau Airstrip at 11:01.The route of the fourth flight from Rau to CYMA was the reverse of the previous flight. The aircraft entered Granite Creek at 4300 feet ASL and was flying at a ground speed of 156 knots.Eyewitnesses at an exploration camp approximately halfway along Granite Creek heard and then observed the aircraft flying at near tree-top level. The cloud bases to the west of the exploration camp were at tree-top level.As it passed the exploration camp, the aircraft turned south into a box canyon, departing from the intended route. It headed toward rising terrain that led to the north face of Mount Albert. The aircraft began to climb and shortly thereafter was observed to disappear into the clouds and fog at 11:12. The aircraft impacted terrain approximately 30 seconds later, in a near wings-level attitude with the flaps in the up position. The 2 occupants were fatally injured on impact.

3,ACC2281,"A Cessna S550 Citation S/II of the South African Civil Aviation Authority crashed into the Outeniqua mountains, near the town of Friemersheim. The three occupants were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.The Citation departed Port Elizabeth Airport (FAPE) on a positioning flight to George Airport (FAGG). On approach to FAGG, the flying crew requested to carry out a calibration flight for the very high frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) beacon at FAGG. Due to inclement weather conditions at the time, they were not cleared to conduct VOR calibration. As a result, they decided to land and refuel the aircraft before commencing with the calibration of the Instrument Landing System (ILS) on runway 11 at FAGG. The flying crew requested take-off from runway 11 and an early right turn to intercept radial 250°, 17 nautical miles (nm) DME arc to radial 330° at 3000 feet (ft) climbing to 4000ft. The air traffic control (ATC) granted their request.Radar data indicated that at 10:42, the aircraft took off from runway 11 and, once airborne, made a right-hand turn to intercept radial 250° using the George VOR (GRV VOR). The aircraft climbed to 3000ft. Once the aircraft reached 17nm on the DME from the GRV VOR (DME is co-located with the VOR), it commenced with a right-hand turn to intercept radial 330° while maintaining 17nm DME arc.At 10:46, the ATC at FAGG advised the flying crew that they were now exiting controlled airspace and were advised to broadcast on the special rules frequency. The crew acknowledged the advisory to change frequency and there was no further communication. The aircraft was still being monitored by ATC using secondary surveillance radar.At 10:50, radar data showed the aircraft crossing radial 310° and entered a climb from 3000ft, reaching 3900ft. As the aircraft levelled off at 3900ft, a rapid descent occurred, and the aircraft lost 1500ft in approximately 9 seconds. Three seconds prior to impact, the aircraft nose pitched up before impacting a ridge at 2192ft."

The en route part of the flight was uneventful. At 08:29 the flight was cleared for a straight in back-course ILS approach to runway 29. The first officer, who had just been promoted to Boeing 707 operations, was to perform the approach in blowing snow conditions. This approach was the first one after a 6-week holiday, so he lacked recent Boeing 707-experience. With the added factors of fatigue, turbulent air, and a heavily loaded aircraft the situation would have become extremely difficult. At some point late in the approach the captain took over control of the aircraft and tried to arrest the sink rate. The plane contacted poplar trees, 3137 m short of the runway. It struck the ground a glancing blow, and the tail fin struck powerlines. The aircraft finally struck a large ridge in the middle of a gravel pit.

The last recorded datapoint was at 06:22:35 at 3225 feet. CCTV footage and dashcam appears to show the aircraft in an extremely steep descent before it crashed in a wooded mountainous area.The location where the descent from 29100 feet was initiated, coincides with the point where flight MU5735 began its descent (also from 29100 feet), the day before the accident."
98,ACC2376,"A Cessna 208B Grand Caravan crashed on the roof of an industrial building in Heyburn, Idaho, USA, while attempting to land at Burley Municipal Airport, ID (BYI). The pilot suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft departed Salt Lake City International Airport, Utah (SLC) at 07:00 hours local time (13:00 UTC) on a cargo flight to BYI. The pilot aborted the first approach to runway 20 at BYI at 08:11. The pilot executed the published missed approach procedure and reported over IREME.The controller then cleared the pilot for another RNAV approach to runway 20. After the pilot reported that she had crossed the initial approach fix, the controller approved a change to BYI advisory frequency.According to a witness, the aircraft descended out of the clouds and then immediately went into a steam cloud, which was produced from a set of six smokestacks located on the roof of a processing plant. The witness heard the engine increase in sound and saw the nose lift shortly before the airplane struck the smokestack and descend to the rooftop.The aircraft crashed 700 m north-east of the threshold of runway 20. At the time of both approaches, visibility at the airport was limited due to snowfall."
100,ACC2378,"An Antonov An-26B-100 transport plane crashed after striking powerlines near Mykhailivka, Ukraine, shortly after takeoff from Zaporozhye Airport (OZH). One of the three crew members suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft had been stuck at OZH following the Russian invasion of Ukrainen that started on February 24, 2022. Almost two months later, UR-UZB was to be ferried to Uzhgorod Airport (UDJ), away from the OZH due to fighting going on in the vicinity.In the 90 days prior to the accident, the captain had just flown for 85 minutes while the copilot and flight engineer had not made any flights."
264,ACC238,"About 15 minutes before the planned landing at Perm at an altitude of 5400 meters, the aircraft suddenly banked heavily to the right and then to the left. The An-24 spiralled down reaching a speed of almost 1000 km/h. At an altitude of 2700 m the aircraft gained some lift again and went into an upward looping. On top of it the airframe broke apart due to the high g loads. Afterwards, it fell down with a horizontal speed of 20 to 30 km/h and a vertical speed of 250 to 270 km/h. Of the 39 people aboard, about four people survived the crash as the fuselage fell on a thick layer of snow. Because of the bitter cold (- 41° C) the survivors died before rescue parties arrived. The official investigation could not establish the cause of the crash. However, clues indicating the explosion of a missile were found, e.g. dots of green paint which was not from the aircraft. The Ministry of Defence denied that there were any exercises in the area. And according to the Meteorological Service there were no launches of weather balloons in the area."
103,ACC2381,"Tara Air flight 197, a DHC-6 Twin Otter 300, impacted a mountainside at 14500 feet while on a domestic flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, Nepal. All 22 occupants suffered fatal injuries.The flight was the first of five Tara Air flights from Pokhara to Jomsom that day and scheduled to depart at 06:15 hours. The flight was delayed because the Lete Pass on the route was covered up with clouds. The Twin Otter finally departed at 09:55, after two aircraft of Summit Air had departed for Jomsom. 9N-AET was supposed to take-off as the second flight but the captain seemed hesitant to commence  the flight due to a weather report from the first Summit Air flight that, the en-route weather was not favorable for VFR flights and critical around LETE and TATOPANI.The cockpit voice recording revealed that someone, either ground staff or some intimate passenger to the crew, advised the PIC strongly to conduct the flight.The aircraft took off from Pokhara from runway 04. The Tower controller instructed to ""report 5 DME northwest runway 04"". Then after departure the aircraft turned left to maintain a heading of 345 and planned to join heading 305 degree towards Ghodepani. After four minutes, flight 197 reported, ""Now on course... 6000 climbing and ETA Jomsom 32"" (0432 UTC). At 04:21 UTC flight 197 reported to Pokhara Tower as position approaching Ghodepani 12000 climbing for 12500. After 6 Seconds ATC Pokhara asked flight 197, ""confirm would like to change level and TRA 197 replied, No Ma'am we have crossed Ghodepani and like to be on. Pokhara Tower instructed, Tara 197 contact Jomsom Tower 122.5CVR recordings show that after flight 197 crossed Ghodepani, the PIC was not comfortable with the en-route weather. However, the flight was continued following the advice of the preceding Summit Air flight. At 04:26 UTC, flight 197 made the first contact with Jomsom AFS and reported its position to which Jomsom Tower conveyed the prevailing weather as ""Wind South Westerly up to 30 kts, QNH 1019, Temp 18º"". The PIC of flight 197 reconfirmed twice if the wind was maximum, up to 30 kts and currently South Westerly 25 kts. The crew was discussing about the bad weather being  encountered and the PIC himself voiced his dissatisfaction about the behavior of other pilots who conduct VFR flights in such unfavorable weather. The CVR recordings reveal that the aircraft was encountering clouds and the PIC was trying his best to remain clear of the clouds. The PIC was searching for light and brighter areas and adamantly heading towards it. The aircraft was maintaining 12000 ft and was in a climbing attitude. During the continuous attempts of crew to avoid the clouds with Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS) inhibited, the aircraft struck rocky terrain at an altitude of 4050 meters AMSL at Sanusare Mountain. The cockpit voice recoerder readout showed that the aural GPWS warning, a function of TAWS, was triggered approximately 3 seconds prior to the impact. However, there was no aural warning of enhanced Forward Looking Terrain Alert (FLTA), Premature Descent Alert (PDA), and Imminent Terrain Impact (ITI) Alert/Warning function of TAWS.Further investigation of tht TAWS showed that it was configured to use GPS altitude, however no data was received by the system. This was likely caused by the misconfiguration of the RS-232 output format from the Garmin GPS receiver. As a result Corrected Barometric Altitude (CBA), computed by the Air Data Computer (ADC), was the only altitude input. In order to compute a reliable CBA, a regional barometric pressure setting must be entered into the ADC. This had not been done, so during the previous flights the CBA was off by 73 to 866 feet.Due to an overabundance of nuisance alerts, the TAWS was inhibited."
104,ACC2382,"A Cessna 208B Supervan 900 (Honeywell TPE331-12JR 850 hp engine) skydive configured airplane was substantially damaged when it crashed in a field about 1/4 mile short of runway 25 of Oceanside Municipal Airport (OCN/KOKB), California.The pilot in training was fatally injured and the pilot was seriously injured.On the day of the accident, the pilots were performing skydiving flights while the right-seated pilot was training the left-seated pilot on the operation. A flight would consist of the pilots taking a group of approximately 17 skydivers to an altitude of about 11,500 feet mean sea level (msl) to jump out and then they would land back at the airport. The flights started about 10:15 and were an average of 17 minutes in duration with about 15 minutes on the ground between each flight; the airplanes engine was operating the entire duration. The pilots completed six flights without incident and departed on the accident flight at 13:31.The right-seated pilot remembered that on the accident flight everything was normal with the departure and the unloading of the skydivers. The airplane was descending as expected with the power at idle. As the airplane turned onto final approach, about 3 miles from the approach end of runway 25, the right-seated pilot attempted to increase the power by slightly nudging the throttle forward. He noticed that the engine power did not increase as expected and moved the throttle lever further forward. The lever was still unresponsive, and he estimated the airplane was about 400 ft above ground level (agl). He aimed for an open dirt field and observed a berm in the immediate flight path. In an effort to avoid the berm, the pilot maneuvered the airplane into a right turn.ADS-B data show that the airplanes speed dropped to 92 kts as it passed through 500 ft msl. The last recorded hit was at 13:47:10 and located about 975 feet east of the accident site. At that time, the data indicated that the airplane was at 100 msl (equivalent to 60 feet above ground level) at a speed of 68 kts. Witness stated that they observed the airplane flying at a very low altitude. The airplane then pitched down in a nose-low attitude and bank to the right. The airplane impacted terrain and collided with the side of a berm. On February 24, 2022 another Cessna 208B Grand Caravan of GoJump Oceanside crashed about the same location during approach to runway 25, seriously injuring both occupants."

112,ACC2390,"A CASA C-212 Aviocar 200, N497CA, was substantially damaged when it was involved in an accident near Raeford, North Carolina, USA. The pilot-in-command was not injured, and the second-in-command sustained fatal injuries during the subsequent diversion to the Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), North Carolina. The pilot-in-command (PIC) reported that they flew two skydiving runs then descended to the Raeford West Airport (NR20), North Carolina, to pick up a third group of skydivers.The second-in-command (SIC) was flying the approach to NR20 and was ""on heading, altitude and airspeed"" until the airplane descended below the tree line and ""dropped."" Both pilots called for a go-around maneuver, which the SIC initiated; however, before the SIC could arrest the airplanes sink rate and initiate a climb, the right main landing gear (RMLG) impacted the runway surface. The PIC assumed the flight controls upon the airplane reaching 400 ft agl, then flew a low approach over NR20 to have airfield personnel verify damage. The personnel subsequently called the PIC to let him know that they recovered the fractured RMLG on the runway. The PIC directed the SIC to declare an emergency and request a diversion to RDU for landing.While enroute to RDU, the crew coordinated with air traffic control, operations, and their customer, and planned their approach and landing at RDU, with the SIC responsible for communicating with air traffic control while the PIC flew the airplane. The PIC reported that there was moderate turbulence during the flight, and that about 20 minutes into the diversion to RDU, after conducting approach and emergency briefings, the SIC became visibly upset about the hard landing. In his final transmission, the SIC acknowledged a course heading from air traffic control. The PIC described that about this time the SIC opened his side cockpit window, and ""may have gotten sick."" The PIC took over radio communications, and the SIC lowered the ramp in the back of the airplane, indicating that felt like he was going to be sick and needed air. The PIC stated that the SIC then got up from his seat, removed his headset, apologized, and departed the airplane via the aft ramp door. The PIC stated that there was a bar one could grab about 6 ft above the ramp; however, he did not witness the SIC grab the bar before exiting the airplane. The PIC then turned the airplane to the right to search for the SIC. The PIC then proceeded on course to RDU, where he performed a low-approach and then emergency landing. Upon landing, the airplane departed the right side of the runway and came to rest upright in the grass.Postaccident examination of the airplane revealed substantial damage to the RMLG, landing gear fittings, and the airframe structure where the fittings attach."
113,ACC2391,"A Short SC.7 Skyvan 3M-400 was destroyed when it crashed near Piotrków Trybunalski-Bujny Airport (EPPT), Poland.Both occupants died. On the 12th flight of the day, after dropping skydivers, the plane began to descend for landing back at EPPT. On final approach the pilot reported one and a half minutes to the threshold of RWY 03. The flight coordinator issued a clearance for landing, which was acknowledged by the pilot.Around 14:16 the plane started to climb, then slowed down, and after changing direction it entered a dive and collided with the ground. As a result of the collision, the pilot and passenger died on the spot, and the plane was destroyed.Preliminary information indicates the aircraft dropped 20 skydivers earlier in the flight and was returning to the airport. The aircraft crashed under unknown circumstances in a field while on approach to the airport, photos from the scene show that the aircraft was completely destroyed, but there was no post crash fire."
114,ACC2392,"A float-equipped de Havilland Canada DHC-3T Turbine Otter, N725TH, was destroyed when it impacted the water in Mutiny Bay, Washington. All ten occupants were killed in the accident.The accident flight departed from Friday Harbor Seaplane Base, Washington, about 14:50 with a destination of Renton-Will Rogers Wiley Post Memorial Seaplane Base, Washington. Track data indicated the airplane flew at an en route altitude of 650 to 975 ft above mean sea level (msl), and the groundspeed was between 115 and 125 knots.At 15:08:43, the airplane pitched up about 8° and then abruptly pitched down about 58°. The data ended at 15:08:51, when the airplanes altitude was 600 ft msl and the estimated descent rate was more than 9,500 ft per minute.Witnesses near the accident site reported that the airplane was in level flight before it entered a slight climb, then pitched down in a near-vertical descent. The airplane continued in a nose low, spiraling, near-vertical descent until it impacted water in Mutiny Bay.The wreckage was located a week later, at a depth of 190 feet."
120,ACC2398,"Precision Air flight 494, an ATR 42-500, came down in Lake Victoria while on final approach to Bukoba Airport (BKZ), Tanzania.The pilot, copilot and seventeen passengers died in the accident.The aircraft took off from Dar es Salaam at 06:10 hours Local Time and the estimated time of arrival al Bukoba was 08:25. The enroute weather was reported to be fine and the flight to Bukoba was uneventful.The weather at Bukoba was good up to 08:20 when it abruptly changed and started raining with thunderstorms and strong winds. The reported visibility reduced from 10 km to 2 km. The flight reached Bukoba at 08:25 to find that the weather had changed several minutes earlier. There were thunderstorms, Cumulonimbus (CBs) clouds and strong winds. According to eye witnesses the aircraft circled twice in the Bukoba area and the crew advised the passengers that the flight may have to divert to Mwanza if the weather at Bukoba did not improve. However, on the third attempt, the runway became visible and the pilot initiated the approach to runway 31. On final approach the aircraft impacted the water of Lake Victoria. The main landing gear separated and the cabin floor was dislodged by the impact, allowing water to enter the cabin at high pressure as the aircraft decelerated before coming to a stop.Canoes and fishermen arrived after about 5 minutes and they transferred the survivors to their boats. Two crew members and 22 passengers were rescued.Bukoba has a single runway (13/31), 1385 m long. Distance between the shore and the runway 31 threshold is 130 meters."
121,ACC2399,"The Cessna 208B Grand Caravan EX, N2069B, was destroyed when it impacted terrain in Snohomish, Washington. All four onboard were killed.The aircraft was operated by Raisbeck Engineering in a flight testing program to obtain a Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) for an aerodynamic drag reduction system (DRS) on the Cessna 208B EX. The company already held such an STC for the Cessna 208B model. The airplane began flights to support the flight-test three days before the accident. The program started out with flight-test data-collection flights to establish baseline data.The purpose of the accident flight was to complete a test that was cut short the day prior, which was baseline testing of the airplane's aft CG stall characteristics. Preliminary radar track data indicated that after departing Renton, Washington around 09:25, the airplane continued to the north in a gradual climb to about 9,500 ft mean sea level (msl) and began a series of turns/maneuvers. The airplane proceeded for about 45 minutes varying in altitude between about 6,500 ft to 10,275 ft msl. At 10:17 the track data indicated the airplane was climbing to an altitude of 9,700 ft msl and turning to the left, making a near 360° turn and then at 10:19:06, there was a sharp 180° left-turn. The track continued west until the last recorded hit at 10:19:18. During the last 12 seconds the track indicated that the airplanes descent rate exceeded 14,000 ft-per-minute (fpm) and gradually lessened to 8,700 fpm. At the time the flight crew were likely at the second to last maneuver on the test card which specified: 96 kts indicated airspeed; flaps in landing configuration; 930 ft-lbs of torque; propeller rpm fully forward; and accelerated 30° bank to the left.Witnesses reported that they observed the airplane break-up inflight and watched pieces floating down.

278,ACC252,"The Invicta International Airlines Vickers Vanguard was operating on a charter flight from Bristol (BRS) to Basle Mulhouse (BSL). After entering the Basle Mulhouse terminal area, the flight was cleared to continue to the BN NDB. Weather was poor at that time: cloud base at 120 m (390 feet) and a reported runway visual range of 700 (2300 feet) and 1300 m (4250 feet). On arrival at the BN beacon the crew were cleared to descend to 2500 feet and were asked to report over the MN beacon before making a 90 degree left hand turn to finals for runway 16. At 09:56 the crew reported at 2500 feet, followed by a position report of the MN beacon at 09:57:40. When on finals over the BN beacon, the crew reported turning outbound and said they would report at the MN beacon again for another approach. When the crew reported overhead the BN beacon again, the plane was in fact overhead the airfield, flying parallel to the ILS localizer beam. After 1,5 minute the aircraft began to overshoot, correctly making an initial turn to the west. The crew, now flying well south of the field, were instructed to report back over the MN beacon. When reporting over the MN beacon again, before it would have to turn left for finals, the plane was in fact overhead the BS beacon, a beacon located to the south of runway 16. At 10:11:25 the crew reported over the BN beacon on finals and was cleared to land. In fact the plane was now flying 3 miles South of the field and 1 mile west of the extended centerline. Two miles further on Basle ATC asked the crew ""Are you sure you are over the BN?"". The captain replied ""I think I've got a spurious indication. We are on the LO... on the ILS now, sir"". Half a minute later the captain radioed ""BN is established on localizer and glide path; the ADF's all over the place in this weather."" Last radio contact was when the captain reported at 1400 feet, to which ATC replied that the flight was probably to the south of the airport.

The aircraft was engaged in spraying pesticides to control spruce budworm in the Quebec wilderness.It is concluded that after takeoff the flaps were inadvertently selected up. The selection was made at a lower than normal altitude and prior to obtaining the minimum flap retraction speed. A sink rate developed, which the pilot recognized and tried to correct by rotating the aircraft. When this failed to arrest the sink rate, the pilots realized the flaps were up or coming up, and then reselected the flaps to the takeoff position.

The beacon was off the air for 49 minutes.In 1976 the Canadian government settled a lawsuit by agreeing to pay USD 1,2 million to the widow and children of one of the passengers."
302,ACC276,"A Lisunov Li-2 passenger plane, CCCP-73960, was destroyed when it crashed shortly after takeoff from Kirov Airport (KVX), Russia. All three crew members were killed; the six passengers survived.During takeoff, immediately after lifting off the runway, the no. 1 (left hand) engine started backfiring. The crew decided to return to the airport and initiated a left hand turn at an altitude of 50-60 meters. Altitude and speed could not be maintained. The airplane reached supercritical angles of attack and struck the ground 480 m past the end of the runway and 380 meters to the left of the runway at a snow-covered field near the edge of a forest."
305,ACC279,"The Yak-40 attempted a takeoff from a wet grass runway (length 1,080 metres) at Rostov. The airplane was not able to lift off and the pilot decided to abort the takeoff. However, the jet failed to stop on the remaining runway and overran by 185 metres. It collided with a hummock, broke up and came to rest in a ravine.The aircraft operated on a flight from Lipetsk to Mineralnye Vody with an en route stop at Rostov."
306,ACC280,The pilot lost control in a steep bank. Density altitude was about 12000 feet.
307,ACC281,An electrical short circuit caused an unwanted extension of the ground and flight spoilers during a training flight. Control was lost; the aircraft made several 360 degree rolls and then dove into a swampy area.
310,ACC284,"After a training flight of 3h14 min an overshoot was practiced on Cairo runway 23. The aircraft, named ""Nefertiti"", lost control and crashed while climbing out."
312,ACC286,An engine failure was simulated on the downwind leg by reducing power on the no. 1 engine. The aircraft stalled on finals and crashed 500 m short of runway 18.
313,ACC287,"The Il-18 departed Bamako (BKO), Mali on a flight to Mecca via Niamey (NIM) and Kano (KAN), Nigeria. The crew of the Il-18 diverted to Ouagadougou (OUA) because of bad weather at the Niamey. Presumably a navigational error was made, causing the crew to circle the wrong town. The aircraft ran out of fuel and a forced landing was carried out."
314,ACC288,"The Viscount struck the Cerro Piache, 8 m below the summit. At the time of the crash tropical storm Alma was passing by Trinidad, 60 miles to the east. The co-pilot on this flight,  Ivan Magallanes, initially survived the accident. He died however 17 days later as a result of severe and irreversible brain damage."
317,ACC291,Missing during sea bird survey flight and never found.
318,ACC292,"The aircraft took off from Fairbanks at 21:08 for an IFR flight to Bettles, then proceeding visually to the Detrich camp. The aircraft was seen descending for Bettles when it suddenly made a 360deg roll, with parts of the wing fluttering to the ground. The remainder spiralled down until it struck the ground. The right wing had failed near Station 183 (near the no. 3 engine) in moderate turbulence."
319,ACC293,"Lockheed L-188 Aircraft CF-PAB operated as Panarctic flight 416 and departed Calgary International Airport at 18:05 hours 29 October 1974. The aircraft was on a routine positioning flight to Edmonton with a pilot-in-command, co-pilot and flight engineer on board. The 30-minute flight was uneventful with no unserviceabilities reported by the crew. The aircraft was prepared for the continuing flight north with the loading of 20000 lb of baggage and freight and 21000 lb of jet B fuel. The aircraft pilot-in-command and flight engineer were replaced by those scheduled for the Edmonton to Rea Point leg.The pilot-in-command received a weather briefing; an IFR flight plan was filed at an initial cruising altitude of 18000 ft with Pedder Point as the alternate.The estimated time en-route was 4 hours 12 minutes. After loading 30 passengers and a fourth crew man, the loadmaster/flight attendant, the aircraft departed the Edmonton International Airport at 20:04 hours. The flight proceeded uneventfully, cruising at 18 000ft to Fort Smith where it was cleared to flight level 210. The aircraft reported over Byron Bay at 23:04 hours with an estimated time of arrival at Rea Point of 00:16. About 100 miles north of Byron Bay the aircraft was cleared to flight level 250.Radio contact was established with Rea Point about 150 miles out and a descent was started for a straight-in VOR/DME approach to runway 33. The descent was smooth except for some turbulence at 4000 ft. The aircraft levelled at 17 miles DME from Rea Point at 2000 ft for a period of 1 minute 45 seconds. The aircraft then slowly descended to about 875 ft ASL at 6 miles DME. A call was made to Rea Point advising them of the DME range on final. There was light turbulence. Fifteen hundred horsepower was selected on the engines; both the VHF navigation radios were selected to the Rea Point VOR frequency and both ADF's were selected to the Rea Point OX nondirectional beacon. Both cockpit barometric altimeters were set to 29.91 in of mercury, the latest Rea Point setting. The airspeed was indicating 150 kt which, with a 30 kt headwind component, resulted in a ground speed of 120 kt. The pre-landing check had been completed, 100 per cent flap selected and the landing gear was down. The landing lights were extended but were off, the wing leading edge lights as well as the alternate taxi lights were on. Glare had been experienced from external lights early in the descent from 10000 ft, but not thereafter. There was no pre-landing briefing conducted by the pilot-in-command.The flight engineer was able to see what appeared to be open water below with ice. The co-pilot set his radio altimeter warning to 450 ft and the pilot-in-command set his to 300 ft. When the warning light came on the co-pilot's radio altimeter, he advised the pilot-in-command. As the descent continued through the minimum descent altitude of 450 ft, the co-pilot reset his radio altimeter to 300 ft and so advised the pilot-in-command. The aircraft was still in a shallow descent. At 300 ft radio altitude the co-pilot checked the DME reading as 3 miles, saw a dark area of open water and an ice line and reported to the pilot-in-command that they seemed to be approaching an ice ridge and that they had visual contact. The pilot-in-command reset his radio altimeter to about 150 ft. Also, close to this time the pilot-in-command said he believed they were on top of a layer of cloud, repeated the statement, following which he retarded the throttles and pushed forward on the control column with sufficient force to produce perceptible negative G.The rate of descent increased rapidly to between 1700 and 2000 ft a minute. The co-pilot shouted at the pilot-in-command reporting their descent through 200 ft at 2 miles DME but there was no response. The flight engineer and the co-pilot both called through 50 ft without an observed reaction from the pilot-in-command. The co-pilot reached for the right side power levers and found the flight engineer's hands already on them. On impact, the cockpit area broke away from the remainder of the fuselage and with the cargo continued along the ice surface for 900 ft. After the cockpit came to rest, the flight engineer undid his seat belt and saw both the pilot-in-command and co-pilot in their seats. The co-pilot although injured was able to undo his seat belt and the flight engineer pulled him on to the ice before the cockpit section sank completely."
320,ACC294,"Crashed on takeoff. The pilot and copilot were killed, ten passengers were slightly injured and the hostess and remaining eleven passengers were unharmed."
321,ACC295,"Boeing 747 D-ABYB was taking off for the last leg of the Frankfurt (FRA) - Nairobi (NBO) - Johannesburg (JNB) flight when the crew felt vibration or buffeting following lift off. The captain, suspecting wheel imbalance, raised the gear. A lack of acceleration forced the crew to lower the nose in order to maintain airspeed. The Boeing continued to descend however and contacted the ground 1120 m past the end of runway 24 and struck an elevated road 114 m further on. The aircraft broke up and caught fire before coming to rest 454 m past the initial point of impact."
322,ACC296,"An Antonov An-12B (CCCP-12985) of Aeroflot's East Siberia Division departed Irkutsk Airport on a training flight with seven crew members on board. As the An-12 was practicing the ninth approach to Irkutsk Airport, another aircraft (Antonov An-2R CCCP-49342 of Aeroflot's East Siberia Division) was cleared for takeoff.The An-12 was cleared to go around and at the same time the An-2 commenced its takeoff roll. At an altitude of 270 meters over the runway both aircraft collided.The An-2 fell to the ground 200 meters north of the runway. The aircraft partially burned out and all 13 aboard were killed.The crew of the An-12 felt a strong blow and the plane began to roll to the left. The crew shut down the engines and made an emergency landing in the floodplain of the Ushakovka River at a distance of 3980 m from the end of runway 30. During the ground slide both left engines separated from the wing. The aircraft knocked down a 10 m high mast, which then fell onto the fuselage, completely destroying the center section. The plane stopped after aground slide of 220 meters. There was no fire and the crew was not injured."
325,ACC299,"A locked elevator forced the pilot to abort the takeoff roll. The Yak-40 failed to stop within the remaining runway length and overran, hitting an earthen dyke. A fire broke out, almost completely consuming the aircraft."
326,ACC300,"Visibility was poor due to snowfall when the Islander departed Tacoma Airport for Oak Harbor. Shortly after takeoff the airplane collided with terrain in the residential area of Riverton Heights, WA. Unknown matter in the pitot tube had caused unreliable readings of the airspeed indicator."
327,ACC301,"A Gulfstream II corporate jet, the presidential jet of Togo President Gnassingbé Eyadéma, was damaged beyond repair in a fatal accident near Lome Airport (LFW). Three crew members were killed but all three passengers survived.The corporate jet was returning from Niamey Airport (NIM) where it had taken Niger President Seyni Kountche. In January 1974 Togo President Gnassingbé Eyadéma had lost his Presidential Douglas C-47 in an accident."
330,ACC304,Crashed into a hill.
331,ACC305,"Golden West Flight 261 departed Ontario, CA at 15:56PST for a VFR flight to Los Angeles. At 16:04 the crew contacted LAX arrival and reported over Rose Hills. The flight was then cleared for the Terminal Control Area (TCA) and no. 2 arrival to runway 24L. At 16:05 the crew were advised that they had traffic 5,5nm in front of them climbing from 1500 to 3000 feet which was a police helicopter on a VFR flight. The arrival controller transmitted another advisory about the helicopter at 16:06, but there was no response. It appeared the Twin Otter had collided in flight at 2200 feet with a Cessna 150 aircraft (N11421). The Twin Otter was flying on a 250deg heading descending 300 feet/min at 146 knots airspeed while the Cessna was flying at 94 kts; the closing speed was 174 kts. The Cessna, operated by CessnAir Aviation had departed from Long Beach on a local training flight at 15:46. Both aircraft crashed. Debris caused some damage to houses and lawns near the crash site."
334,ACC308,The aircraft crashed in a steep nose down attitude during a 350 deg heading change to intercept the localizer.
335,ACC309,"Weather at Huntsville was below minima, so the flight was diverted to Houston Intercontinental Airport. The runway 08 ILS approach was abandoned due to intermittent operation of the aircraft ILS localizer receiver instruments. The crew then tried an NDB approach with Houston TRICON monitoring on surveillance radar. The DC-3 continued descent below minimum descent altitude until the left wing collided with a 23 m high power line tower, located 3 km short of the runway. About 5 m of wing was torn off; the aircraft continued 195 m before striking the ground in a 30-degree nose down and inverted attitude."
336,ACC310,Three engines had lost power shortly after takeoff from runway 10. The aircraft crashed just 2 km short of runway 19 in an attempt to return to the airport.It appeared that the fuel was contaminated.
338,ACC312,"The Boeing 737, on a domestic flight in Iraq, was hijacked by three passengers. They demanded the release of 85 Kurdish prisoners in Iraq. The aircraft landed at Tehran, Iran. Iraqi security guards opened fire at he hijackers. One passenger was killed and one hijacker and a passenger were injured. The hijackers then surrendered."
339,ACC313,Struck a mountain while descending for an ILS approach. Most of the passengers were soldiers and policemen who took part in flood relief operations in Neuquen Province.
343,ACC317,"On April 26, 1975, a Beechcraft A100, N700SP, was ferried from Savannah, Georgia, to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for a corporate flight to Jackson, Mississippi. The aircraft was owned and operated by Stribling-Puckett, Inc.The flight to Hilton Head Island was completed without incident. The pilot of N700SP loaded the passenger baggage; a witness to the loading indicated that the pilot loaded the baggage carefully in the baggage compartment in the aft end of the cabin.At 21:45, the eight passengers boarded the aircraft with one passenger seated in the copilot's seat.The engines were started and the aircraft was taxied to runway 3 for takeoff. The aircraft was taxied onto the 300-foot overrun on the south end of the runway, turned 180° on the runway, and made a ""running"" takeoff.Two pilots, one inside the terminal and another outside, stated that they did not believe the engines were developing full power during the takeoff. However, there were no unusual sounds, and the engines were operating ""smoothly."" Both of these pilots believed that the takeoff run was excessively long. The aircraft used about 3,900 feet of pavement to takeoff including most of the 300-foot overrun where the takeoff began.After takeoff, the aircraft was leveled off and was flown straight and level for about 1,200 feet. There it struck the top of a tree which was 40 to 50 feet above the ground. After impact with the trees, the aircraft continued 1,200 to 1,300 feet and struck several other trees before it came to rest right side up.Fire erupted some distance behind the aircraft, but progressed toward the aircraft slowly. The slow progression of the fire allowed the three survivors time to escape through a hole in the left front side of the fuselage.Roger W. Stribling, Jr., Vice President of the Stribling-Puckett, Inc, was killed in the crash. Company President Ben Puckett suffered a broken back in the accident.The investigation showed that the aircraft would have been 436 lbs. over the maximum gross takeoff weight, with the center of gravity near the aft limit."
346,ACC320,The aircraft hit trees near the airport. Marijuana was found on board.
347,ACC321,During descent into Manila (at FL200) a bomb exploded in the right lavatory in the rear of the plane. The explosion caused a hole in the fuselage of 1.3 m x 4 m. A successful emergency landing was made.
351,ACC325,The crew deviated from the approach pattern and collided with a wooded hillside in clouds.
353,ACC327,Flight 99 crashed into a mountain and overturned while attempting to land at Gambell runway 15. A fire started in the left engine but spread only slowly to the passenger cabin.Weather was poor with low ceilings and a visibility of 400 m at some places.
355,ACC329,"The DC-3 was flying VFR at FL115 when scattered clouds were encountered. When breaking through a cloud patch a mountain was seen close ahead. A steep climbing turn was initiated, but the tail struck trees. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed inverted on Choke Mountain."

361,ACC335,"The Yak-40 was operating on a domestic flight from Syktyvkar to Riga with en route stops at Vologda and Novgorod. Visibility at the Novgorod Airport (NVR) was poor due to fog, but this had not been forecast. The crew attempted a straight-in approach but the airplane went off course after passing the Outer Marker. The crew descended until the undercarriage and wing contacted a building. The Yak-40 continued and struck an apartment building and a car. A fire erupted."
362,ACC336,"DH-114 Heron registered VH-CLS was operating Connair Flight 1263 from Alice Springs to Cairns landing at Mount Isa en route.At 12:57 hours VH-CLS taxied to runway 30 at Alice Springs and was cleared for takeoff. The flight landed at Mount Isa at 15:35 hours after making a visual approach. At 16:46 hours VH-CLS taxied to runway 34 at Mount Isa, and the flight reported its departure as 16:55 hours at which time it was climbing to its planned cruising altitude of 7000 feet. As the flight progressed position reports at the appropriate reporting points were received. At 18:01 hours, VH-CLS advised that it was descending to cruise at 6000 feet. Subsequently, at 18:49 hours, VH-CLS reported as being at the Saucebottle Creek position, 146 km southwest of Cairns, at an altitude of 6000 feet. The crew indicated an ETA at the Biboohra VOR, 35 km west of Cairns, of 19:12. VH-CLS was then advised by the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller, through the Cairns Flight Service Unit (FSU), to expect an ILS approach to runway 15 at Cairns Airport.At 18:54 hours the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller issued an air traffic clearance, for transmission through the Cairns FSU, authorising VH-CLS to enter the control area via the 049 degree radial of the Biboohra VOR cruising at 6000 feet and using an altimeter setting of 1006 millibars. At about 18:55 hours, the Weather Service Office (WSO) located at Cairns Airport observed a thunderstorm, without precipitation, in the vicinity of the airport and the following 'special' aerodrome weather report was issued: Wind : 360 degrees at 6 knots, visibility : 10 km or more, thunderstorm without precipitation, 1/8 cumulo-nimbus clouds, base 3000 feet, 4/8 cumulus, base 2300 feet, 4/8 strato cumulus, base 4000 feet. This was reported to the crew.At 19:10 hours, VH-CLS reported to the Cairns aerodrome/approach controller that it was over the Biboohra VOR at 6000 feet and, following confirmation by VHCLS that its 'preferred approach' was an ILS approach, it was cleared 'on the Biboohra zero four nine radial, descend to three seven zero zero for an ILS approach runway one five, and report at Buchan Locator'. VH-CLS acknowledged this instruction and advised that the aircraft was leaving 6000 feet. At 19:17:29 hours, VH-CLS reported over the Buchan Locator turning outbound onto a heading of 330 degrees this being the standard ILS procedure; the aerodrome/approach controller cleared the aircraft for an ILS approach and instructed it to report leaving 3700 feet.At 19:20:54 hours, VH-CLS reported 'leaving three seven zero zero' implying that the aircraft had commenced the final approach segment of the ILS approach. The aerodrome/approach controller acknowledged the report and radioed: 'wind from the northwest, maximum downwind component runway one five not above six knots, runway wet, clear to land'. At 19:22:53 hours, the controller notified VH-CLS 'there's a moderately heavy shower at the field now, visibility er is reducing as the shower moves south, visibility to the south at the moment er in excess of four thousand metres, high intensity approach and runway lighting is on, advise when you would like the intensity decreased'. VH-CLS acknowledged.At 19:26:23 hours, VH-CLS reported 'going round' and the aerodrome/approach controller instructed VH-CLS to 'make missed approach on a heading of zero three five and climb to three seven zero zero'. VH-CLS turned away from the airport, descended to a low height above terrain, and completed about 270 degrees of a left hand orbit. It then entered a turn to the right during which it descended and crashed."
365,ACC339,"The An-24 passenger plane, CCCP-46349, was damaged beyond repair in a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident near Kharkov Airport (HRK). One crew member and eighteen passengers were killed; three crew members and 28 passengers survived the accident.Air traffic control reported a wrong QNH setting to the crew. The altimeter was thus programmed with incorrect parameters, causing false altitude indications. The readings of the barometric altimeter differed from the real altitude by 220 metres. On approach to Kharkov in clouds the crew ignored the warning of the ground proximity warning system and continued their descent until the aircraft hit trees, crashing into the slope of a hill.The aircraft operated on a flight from Mineralnyye Vody to Gomel via Rostov and Kharkov."
367,ACC341,"Middle East Airlines flight 438 was a scheduled passenger service that was supposed to departed Beirut Airport, Lebanon on December 31, 1975, bound for Dubai and Muscat.The Boeing 747 that was planned to operate the flight suffered an engine problem. The flight was delayed and a Boeing 720 was prepared to replace the 747. The flight took off from Beirut Airport at 02:10 hours local time on January 1, 1976. The aircraft was en route over the Saudi desert at FL370 when radar and radio contact was lost. It was found to have crashed near Al Qaysumah, killing all 81 on board.An investigation revealed that a bomb had exploded in the forward baggage compartment."
368,ACC342,The DC-6 cargo plane crashed five minutes after take-off. The aircraft had arrived from Panama and offloaded its cargo at Cozumel. It was continuing empty to Mexico City.
369,ACC343,The Ilyushin was operating on a training flight and the crew was practicing a simulated dual engine failure with Nos. 3 and 4 engines shut down. Control was lost when the captain attempted a go-around but the No. 3 engine failed to relight. The propeller caused strong drag and the aircraft rolled and impacted with 55-60 degrees right bank.
371,ACC345,"When close-in on a straight-in approach to runway 14, the pilot requested a 360 degree turn to lose altitude. During this turn the right wing struck the surface and was torn off. The aircraft slid along the ground on its right side, struck a rock outcrop, and came to rest 350 ft from the point of initial impact. Examination of the fuel system revealed that the fuel supply for the right engine was not transferring automatically to the no.4 cell which feeds the engine, but was spreading out by gravity to the other cells. This would be aggravated in a descent, and it is likely that the right engine flamed out during the turn due to fuel starvation.The flapper valves in no.4 and 5 tanks were not of the approved type and were not installed properly. The fuel injector nozzle in the fuel transfer system for the right engine was plugged due to the coarse mesh fuel strainers which allowed foreign particles to penetrate."
375,ACC349,The navaids calibration aircraft continued visual flight in instrument conditions. It struck a mountain in clouds.
376,ACC350,"Flight 60 was making a runway 11 ILS approach under conditions of low ceilings and low visibility. Descending through 4000 feet visual contact with the ground and water was acquired. The captain decided to proceed visually. The aircraft touched down fast (at 145kts) with a 3 knots tailwind component.Braking action was poor, so the captain decided to execute a go-around. Ground spoilers were retracted, flaps set at 25deg. The thrust reversers didn't disengage fully, so full takeoff thrust couldn't be obtained. Attempts to disengage the reversers failed, so ground spoilers were deployed again. The aircraft overran the wet runway, crossed a gully and a service road, struck the antenna array support structure and continued before ending up in a ravine, 700 feet past the runway."
377,ACC351,"The Avro 748 aircraft, named ""Ciudad de Corrientes"", was making a staff-transfer flight for the Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales (YPF) State Enterprise. It began in Cutral-Có at 14:00 and the aircraft landed 40 minutes later on a Company landing strip in Rincón de Los Sauces. The aircraft took off at 15:55 for Cutral-Có again with 31 passengers and 3 crew.At 16:23 the crew contacted Cutral-Có and asked for information on the local state of the weather and estimated landing at 16:33. At an altitude of about 4000 feet the starboard wing failed, followed by separation of the starboard tailplane. The remainder of the plane corkscrewed and crashed."
380,ACC354,"The aircraft stalled and crashed on approach to runway 20. It struck water at an angle of about 60°, facing the direction  of approach.On board were Tun Fuad Stephens, the first Chief Minister of the state of Sabah in Malaysia along with several cabinet members.The final investigation report mentions that the pilot had exceeded his company duty time of 10 hours by 67 minutes. Additionally, the pilot reported feeling unwell before his previous flight and before the accident flight."
381,ACC355,"The Antonov strayed to the right off course while on approach to Nizhneangarsk. The airplane flew into a mountainside, killing the crew."
382,ACC356,"The Antonov lost height after the engine lost power. It hit a power line pole, crashed and burned."
383,ACC357,"The airplane impacted the ground in poor visibility conditions.The aircraft, a Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane, was a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft G18S. The conversion was carried out in 1974."
384,ACC358,"During the certification process, the GAF N24 Nomad encountered problems with longitudinal stability at the 20° flap setting. In the opinion of the Chief Test Pilot, the stick force gradient was unacceptable at the 20° flap setting. While the longitudinal stability problem may not have affected Australian certification of the N24, it was considered important to solve the problem for a developed version of the aircraft. Accordingly, the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) made and flight tested a series of modifications to the tailplane. Before the accident flight the full-span trim tabs were fitted with 50 mm T strips.The purpose of the flight on which the accident occurred was to examine the effect of these tailplane modifications on the longitudinal stability of the aircraft in the 20 degree flap configuration required for the N24A model. It was intended that, after take-off, the aircraft would proceed to a designated flight test area where, at a safe altitude, the tests would be carried out. The aircraft was not to be flown at a speed in excess of 120 knots equivalent airspeed (EAS). At 10:51 hours the pilot of the aircraft, using his personal radio callsign GAF ONE, contacted Avalon Tower by radio and advised that he had received the current aerodrome terminal information and was taxiing. The aircraft then taxied to the east-west grass strip.At 10:58 hours Avalon Tower advised the aircraft of the local weather and that there were aircraft reports of extensive cloud and build-ups to the south-west moving in a north-easterly direction. The pilot acknowledged this information. At 11:00 hours the aircraft notified that it was ready for take-off and the controller advised that there would be a short delay, which was due to other traffic landing on the runway. At 11:00:23 hours the Nomad was cleared for take-off and an unrestricted climb.The aircraft took off into the west from the grass strip and, immediately it became airborne, the pilot applied a series of 'push-pull' control inputs to the tailplane after which the aircraft commenced its initial climb. The aircraft climbed straight ahead in a normal manner and reached a height of about 950 feet when over or just past the runway. At this point three witnesses on the ground observed the trailing edge of the aircraft's tailplane fluttering and he saw a dark object fall from the aircraft to the ground. At about this time the aerodrome controller, located in the control tower some 1250 metres south-east of the aircraft, saw it adopt a steep nose-down attitude and asked whether operations were normal. The pilot replied 'negative', and the aerodrome controller then initiated emergency procedures and the crash alarm was sounded.The aircraft then turned left onto a southerly heading while still descending, and may have maintained this heading briefly before continuing to turn left onto an easterly heading. Just prior to contact with the ground, the left wing and the nose dropped, and after impact the aircraft rotated through 120 degrees in the horizontal plane and skidded rearwards for a distance of some 70 metre before coming to rest. For the flight on which the accident occurred the aircraft carried the trade-plate registration VH-SUZ."
388,ACC362,"The DHC-3 Otter was one of two floatplanes chartered for the Royal Commission on Electric Power Planning for Ontario.The final leg of the flight was from Winisk to Timmins/Porcupine Lake Water Aerodrome, Ontario, Canada. The pilot diverted to Moosonee after encountering deteriorating weather. The next day, at 12:30, the flight departed for the two-hour VFR-flight to Timmins.Because some of passengers had limited time to catch onwards flights from Timmins Airport, the pilot decided to take a direct route between the Moosonee and Timmins NDBs. He likely tried to navigate around areas of low clouds and high terrain. The aircraft followed the Abitibi River southward towards Abitibi Canyon Dam. The valley narrows and the terrain rises at this site of the power dam. It is believed that the pilot found the visibility decreasing rapidly in dense upslope fog in this vicinity. At 13:37 hours the aircraft struck the high tension electrical cables near the generating station and crashed to the ground."
390,ACC364,"Crashed into Mount Xiabre while fighting a forest fire, killing all crewmembers."
391,ACC365,"Aeroflot Flight 7957, an Antonov An-24RV and Aeroflot Flight 31, a Yakovlev 40, crashed following a mid-air collision over the Black Sea. All 52 on board the An-24 and all 18 occupants of the Yak-40 were killed.The An-24 (CCCP-46518) operated on a flight from Gomel to Donetsk and Sochi and took off at Donetsk Airport at 12:56 hours local time.  The Yak-40 (CCCP-87772) took off from Rostov at 12:47, bound for Kerch.Both aircraft were en route at an altitude of 5700 meters.

430,ACC404,"On October 13, 1977, Lufthansa flight LH181, a Boeing 737 flying from Palma de Mallorca (PMI) to Frankfurt (FRA) with 91 passengers and crew, was hijacked by four members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, calling themselves ""Commando Martyr Halime"". The aircraft diverted to Rome for refueling. The hijackers demanded the release of eleven Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorists detained in a German prison, and US$15 million. The airplane, named ""Landshut"", continued its journey, landing in Larnaca, Bahrain and Dubai, following a series of denied landing clearances in other airports across the Arabian Peninsula. Flight 181 then flew to Salalah, in Oman, where it was denied landing, and changed course to Aden. As the main runway was blocked by vehicles and the plane was running low on fuel, the captain had no choice but to land on a sand strip nearby. In order to verify the condition of the landing gear following the rough landing, he was allowed to temporarily leave the plane. However, the captain did not immediately return to the plane after the inspection, even after numerous attempts to recall him and a threat to blow up the plane on the ground. The reasons for this prolonged absence are unclear; however, some reports indicate that the captain asked the Yemeni authorities to inhibit the continuation of the flight and to respond to the terrorists' demands. The captain returned to the airplane but he was shot in the head by one of the hijackers. The plane was refuelled and took off at 02:00 on the 17th, piloted by the co-pilot, with course towards the Somali capital of Mogadishu.On October 17, at around 03:30 UTC, the 737 landed in Mogadishu were the captain's body was thrown on the tarmac, and an ultimatum was set for the RAF prisoners to be released by 14:30 UTC. After pouring the duty free spirits over the hostages in preparation for destroying the plane, the hijackers were told that prisoners were to be released and that the transfer to Mogadishu required several more hours, they extended the deadline to the next morning, 00:30 UTC.By order of German chancellor Helmut Schmidt, a team of GSG 9 commandos assembled in Dubai. The team flew to Mogadishu in a white-painted Luftwaffe Boeing 707. After a Somali Ranger battalion had secured the airfield, the team stormed the airliner at 23:05 UTC (October 18 locally). The Somalis had distracted the hijackers for a period with the airport lights, they then lit a petrol tanker in front of the plane.In the seven minute operation, three of the four terrorists were killed; a GSG 9 member and a flight attendant were injured."

434,ACC408,"MAS flight 653 departed Penang, Malaysia at 19:21 hours on a domestic flight to Kuala Lumpur. While descending through an altitude of 4000 feet towards Kuala Lumpur, the crew reported that the plane was hijacked. The hijacker demanded to be flown to Singapore. The aircraft climbed to FL210 and proceeded to Singapore. En route to Singapore, the hijacker reportedly shot both pilots and then himself. The cockpit voice recordings indicate noises suggestive of the cockpit door being broken in, along with a reasonable amount of screaming and cursing. No noises are heard from within the cockpit to indicate any of the three occupants were conscious. The autopilot was then disconnected, possibly due to a pitch input by someone entering the cockpit and trying to control the aircraft. An investigator speculated that someone pulled back on the column, causing a pitch up, followed by an oscillation. This rapidly developed into a high amplitude phugoid oscillation that resulted in a rapid dive. The 737 crashed into a swamp and disintegrated."
435,ACC409,"The aircraft was flying a holding pattern near Salt Lake City because of problems with the electrical system. The flight crew contacted the company maintenance and were absent from the approach control frequency for about 7,5 minutes. During this time the aircraft had entered an area near hazardous terrain.

445,ACC419,"Pacific Western flight 314 was a scheduled service from Edmonton, AB (YEG) to Castlegar Airport, BC (YCG) with stops at Calgary, AB (YYC) and Cranbrook (YXC). The flight departed Calgary at 12:32 in the afternoon. The Boeing 737-200 climbed to FL200 which was reached at 12:38. Calgary ATC then reported to the Cranbrook Aeradio station that flight 314 was underway with an ETA of 13:05. At Cranbrook it was snowing with visibility reported as 3/4 of a mile. A radio equipped snow removal vehicle was sweeping the runway at the time. The Aeradio operator at Cranbrook alerted the driver of the vehicle about the incoming aircraft and gave him the ETA of 13:05; they both expected the flight would report by the ""Skookum Beacon"" on a straight-in approach to runway 16, thus giving the vehicle operator about seven minutes to get off the runway. At 12:46, while descending out of FL180, flight 314 contacted Cranbrook Aeradio. One minute later the crew were advised that snow removal was in progress. No further transmissions were received from the flight by Aeradio. The aircraft passed the Skookum beacon inbound on a straight-in instrument approach, and flew the ILS for runway 16 to touchdown. The aircraft touched down at 12:55 some 800 feet from the threshold and reverse thrust was selected. Suddenly the crew noticed a snow plough on the runway. A go-around was initiated immediately. However one of the thrust-reversers didn't fully re-stow because hydraulic power was automatically cut off at lift-off. The aircraft became airborne prior to the 2000 foot mark, and flew down the runway at a height of 50 to 70 feet, flying over the snow plough. The left engine thrust reverser doors then deployed and the crew rapidly selected the flaps up from 40deg to 15deg. The airplane climbed to 300-400 feet, banked steeply to the left, lost height and side-slipped into the ground to the left of the runway. The aircraft broke up and caught fire."
448,ACC422,"At 12:31 hours the Fokker F-28 was cleared by Kano Control Tower to descend to flight level 65. When reporting field in sight it was asked to maintain same flight level because a Nigerian Air Force MiG-21U jet trainer had been cleared to descend to 500 m off (about 3,000ft QNH) and report overhead. When the jet trainer was on final it was cleared for a touch-and-go and while it was taking off the F-28 reported left hand down wind runway 05 still maintaining FL65. The F-28 was then cleared to descend to circuit altitude and report final as number 1. The jet trainer was informed accordingly and was instructed to let the F-28 land first. At 12:42 hours the F28 was on final and cleared to land. At 12:43 the duty controller observed the aircraft crashing in flames about 2 km before runway 05 threshold."
449,ACC423,"Continental Flight 603 (Los Angeles - Honolulu) received clearance to taxi to runway 06R at 09:01. At 09:22 the flight was cleared to taxi into position and hold. Takeoff clearance was given a minute later, but the crew delayed the acknowledgment, because the captain thought the clearance was given too soon after a heavy jet aircraft had made its takeoff. Acceleration was normal, but while approaching the V1 speed (156 knots) a loud ""metallic bang"" was heard, followed by a quivering. As rejected takeoff procedures were begun, the airspeed continued to increase to 159 knots. The aircraft appeared to be decelerating normally, but with 2000 feet of runway remaining, the flight crew became aware that the rate of deceleration had decreased and they believed that the aircraft would not be able to stop on the runway. The aircraft was steered to the right and departed the right corner of the runway end. About 100 feet beyond the runway, the left main gear broke through the nonload-bearing tarmac surface and failed. A fire erupted in this area as the aircraft turned to the left, coming to rest 664 feet from the runway end and 40 feet right of the extended centreline in a 11deg left wing low and 1,3deg nose-up attitude."

At 09:01:11, after the captain told the local controller how far they were going to extend their downwind leg, the first officer asked, ""Are we clear of that Cessna?"" The flight engineer said, ""Suppose to be""; the captain said, ""I guess""; and the forward jumpseat occupant said, ""I hope.""At 09:01:21, the captain said ""Oh yeah, before we turned downwind, I saw him about one o'clock, probably behind us now.""At 09:01:31, the first officer called, ""Gear down.""At 09:01:38, the first officer said , ""There's one underneath,"" and then, 1 sec. later, he said, ""I was looking at that inbound there.""At 09:01:28, the conflict alert warning began in the San Diego Approach Control Facility, indicating to the controllers that the predicted flightpaths of Flight 182 and the Cessna would enter the computer's prescribed warning parameters. At 09:01:47, the approach controller advised the Cessna pilot of ""traffic in your vicinity, a PSA jet has you in sight, he's descending for Lindbergh."" The transmission was not acknowledged. The approach controller did not inform Lindbergh tower of the conflict alert involving Flight 182 and the Cessna, because he believed Flight 182's flightcrew had the Cessna in sight. The aircraft collided at 09:01:47. Flight 182 was descending and overtaking the Cessna, which was climbing in a wing level attitude. Just before impact, Flight 182 banked to the right slightly, and the Cessna pitched noseup and collided with the right wing of Flight 182.The Cessna broke up immediately and exploded. Segments of fragmented wreckage fell from the right wing and empennage of Flight 182.Flight 182 began a shallow right descending turn, leaving a trail of vaporlike substance from the right wing. A bright orange fire erupted in the vicinity of the right wing and increased in intensity as the aircraft descended. The aircraft remained in a right turn, and both the bank and pitch angles increased during the descent to about 50° at impact."
470,ACC444,"An Antonov An-24B passenger plane, operated by Aeroflot's North Caucasus' Division was damaged beyond repair in an accident in the Gulf of Sivash, Ukraine.All 21 passengers and five crew members were killed.The airplane operated flight SU6515 from Stavropol (STW) to Lviv (LWO) with an en route stop at Simferopol (SIP). En route at an altitude of 2400 m the airplane entered icing conditions in clouds for some 15 to 20 minutes. The de-icing system was switched on too late and that both engines flamed out. When the crew tried to restart the left engine the aircraft entered a spiral and crashed into the shallow Gulf of Sivash."
472,ACC446,Crashed into sea. The airplane carried American oil exports of the Western Desert Petroleum Co.
475,ACC449,"Strong, gusting crosswinds during a runway 06R landing caused the aircraft to roll abruptly and unexpectedly. The ensuing loss of control resulted from inappropriate pilot techniques during the attempt to regain control of the aircraft. Struck the ground."
476,ACC450,The An-26 lost control as a result of shifting cargo and crashed against a hotel.
477,ACC451,Both engines lost power immediately following power increase during a stall recovery. The F-27 was engaged in a series of stall tests.
478,ACC452,"The Antonov 24 operated on a crew training flight out of Samarkand Airport (SKD), Uzbekistan. There were five crew members on board.The ninth approach was flown with the no. 2 propeller feathered. The pilot executed a go around and selected gear up. The airplane turned right until it stalled.It hit the ground at 690 m from the center line of the runway and 1,120 m from the runway end. A post-impact fire broke out."
479,ACC453,"The aircraft departed South Caicos at 17:54, and was observed to approach Grand Turk, but went into a climbing left turn and headed South. At 18:07 an overflying aircraft received an ELT signal for less than two minutes.The pilot had an adverse medical cardiograph report. The possibility of incapacitation resulting in loss of control cannot be excluded."
480,ACC454,The Ilyushin 14FKM operated transportation flights for participants of the 24th Soviet Antarctic expedition.The ski-equipped IL-14 took off from the ice runway at Molodezhnaya Ice Station. At an altitude of 70-80 meters above the ground the plane suddenly descended in a left bank until it impacted a glacier.Investigation revealed that the airplane was caught in a wind shear.
482,ACC456,"The L-410 went out of control while practising flying turns with one prop feathered. The aircraft entered a spin and spiralled down, impacting a snow-covered field near the outer marker."
484,ACC458,"Fokker F-27 F-BYAH suffered aileron vibrations in flight. Modifications were made during December 1978 and January 1979. A test flight was planned on January 28. The airplane was flown by an Air Rouergue captain and co-pilot. Also present on board were a two engineers, a Fokker technician and an Air Alpes pilot. Planned flight time was fifteen minutes at an altitude of FL70 near the RZ beacon. F-BYAH took off from runway 31 at 17:15. Two orbits were flown near the RZ beacon after which the crew positioned the plane for an approach to runway 31. The aircraft struck a cloud-shrouded mountain while turning towards runway heading in preparation for an ILS approach."
485,ACC459,"Shortly after departing Kariba, Air Rhodesia Viscount ""Umniati"" was hit in the jet pipe of the inner port engine by a 9K32 Strela-2 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missile (also known as SA-7), burst into flames and crashed out of control into a ravine in the Vuti African Purchase Area. Responsible for the shoot down were soldiers from Joshua Nkomo's Zimbabwe Peoples Revolution Army (ZIPRA). They were also responsible for shooting down an Air Rhodesia Viscount September 3, 1978."
487,ACC461,"At 14:28 hours Flight 4374 had levelled out at 3000 feet with the undercarriage and flaps up and was being radar vectored for an ILS approach to Auckland Airport. When visual flight conditions were encountered and the captain commenced the descent the aircraft was 9 miles from the runway threshold at an airspeed of approximately 165 knots and in a good position to carry out a normal descent and approach for a landing on runway 05. About one minute later, at 2 minutes 14 seconds prior to colliding with the sea, the aircraft's IAS had increased to 211 knots (11 knots in excess of the company's stipulatedVno) and the aircraft was passing through 1436 feet. Some 1 minute 20 seconds prior to the accident the aircraft's engine power was probably reduced to the minimum recommended setting for a descent. During the base turn the engine power was probably increased as the aircraft maintained an essentially constant altitude and airspeed during this turn. At this point the flaps were still retracted and the aircraft was not aligned with the runway. At that moment a heavy shower was obscuring the runway threshold. The first officer was not able to see any approach or runway lights. The aircraft descended until it collided with the water of Manukau Harbour, 1025 m west of the runway 05 threshold."
488,ACC462,"At 17:49 the flight took off from Los Angeles runway 24L. When the aircraft crossed the departure end of the runway, the right propeller was observedslowing to a stop. As the aircraft crossed the shoreline, popping sounds were heard from the left engine, and the aircraft stopped climbing and turned north paralleling the shoreline. As the aircraft flew north along the shoreline, it descended in a wings-level attitude, it contacted the water smoothly, bounced twice, impacted the water in a nose down attitude, and sank almost immediately near Marina del Rey, about 500 metres off shore."
491,ACC465,"The Tupolev 134 departed Omsk on a cargo flight to Liepaya with an en-route stop at Gorkiy (now Nizhniy Novgorod). The crew carried out an approach at night in conditions of snow and rain (visibility 900 meters). The approach was unstabilized and the plane descended too fast, below the glide slope. At a height of 180 m the crew switched off the autopilot. The plane had deviated to the right of the localizer, and the vertical speed has increased up to 8 m/s. The crew tried to establish visual contact to the ground and to banked to the left. At height of 60 m the power levers were advanced to takeoff thrust, but was already too late. At 00:57 (Moscow time) the Tu-134 clipped trees 1690 m from the runway threshold and 155 m to the right of its extended centerline at height of 10-12 m. Then it turned left, banking 45-degrees and crashed into a railway embankment at height of 2 m, disintegrated and caught fire."
492,ACC466,"The Antonov 26 crashed into a wooded hillside while on approach to Baykit (BKT), Russia. The airplane carried a cargo of oranges, 3700 kg. Some passengers were allowed to travel to Baykit by the captain of the plane.The controller had instructed the crew to carry out a missed approach because runway 24 was blocked. The flight continued on runway heading and just barely climbed until striking the hill."
497,ACC471,"A Howard 350, N1514S, was destroyed when it collided with trees while performing a forced landing near Fort Lauderdale, Florida.One engine had lost power shortly after takeoff. Anti-Detonant Injection fluid was found in the carburettor of the engine."

501,ACC475,"The aircraft departed Beirut on a training flight for the promotion of four first officers to captains. Two touch-and-goes were performed, when after the third touchdown the aircraft yawed abruptly to the right, then to the left and to the right again. The aircraft stalled in a high nose-up attitude, the right wing struck the ground 12 m to the right of Taxiway B3. The plane crashed and came to rest inverted across Taxiway F."
502,ACC476,"The Cessna 501 Citation I/SP corporate jet stalled into the ground 870 feet short of runway 19 at Akron/Canton Regional Airport, OH (CAK) while practicing touch-and-go landings. The pilot failed to use the appropriate checklist and used non-standard approach procedures which resulted in an abnormal approach profile.Pilot-owner Thurman L. Munson was killed in the accident. He was an American Major League Baseball catcher, playing for the New York Yankees."
503,ACC477,"Two Tupolev Tu-134A passenger jets were involved in a mid-air collision near Kurilovka, Soviet Union (now Ukraine). Aeroflot flight 7880, registration CCCP-65735, operated on a flight from Tashkent to Minsk via Donetsk. It departed Donetsk at 13:11 hours. There were seven crew members and 77 passengers on board, including players and coaches of the football team Pakhtakor, heading for a USSR Football Championship game in Minsk. Aeroflot flight 7628, registration CCCP-65816, operated on a flight from Chelyabinsk to Kishinev (now named Chisinau) via Voronezh. The flight departed Voronezh at 12:54. There were six crew members and 88 passengers on board.At 13:17 flight 7628 entered the Southwest sector of the Kharkiv's regional air traffic control area at an altitude of 8400 m. A request, and two subsequent requests, by the crew to climb to 9600 m were denied because of other traffic in the area.At 13:25, flight 7880 reported entering the sector at 5700 meters and requested to continue their climb to 9600 m. The controller initially cleared the flight to 7200 m and subsequently to 8400 m. Both flights were now at the same altitude, on crossing airways. The controller had calculated that the aircraft would be 3 minutes apart at that point. in fact, this was less than a minute.The supervisor of the Southwest sector noticed this and intervened. At 13:34 the supervisor instructed flight 7880 to climb to 9000 meters.A muffled response was heard by the supervisor, who assumed this was a read back from flight 7780. At 13:35:38, while in the clouds at an altitude of 8400 meters, both aircraft collided at an angle of 95°. The cockpit of CCCP-65816 collided with the right wing of CCCP-65735. After the collision, both aircraft both aircraft entered a spin and started to break up.The debris fell to the ground in a large area near the villages of Kurilovka, Nikolaevka and Elizavetovka."
505,ACC479,"Two hours and 18 minutes after takeoff, en route from Norilsk to Krasnoyarsk, all four engines flamed out at 7,800 m due to fuel contamination. The crew attempted to reach Yeniseisk but the airport could not be reached. A forced landing was carried out on a wooded hillside. A fire erupted."
507,ACC481,"A de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger plane was destroyed in an accident near Frobisher Bay Airport, NU (YFB), Canada. All nine on board were killed.The airplane, C-GROW, was being used for a series of flights between Frobisher (YFB) and Brevoort Island, a distance of 119 n.m. These flights were conducted under visual flight rules (VFR) with a Flight Notification filed at Frobisher.Two return flights were accomplished without incident and the aircraft was flown back to Brevoort for another round trip. On the final flight the aircraft, with the same two pilots and with seven passengers, left Brevoort at 21:57 hours local time enroute to Frobisher. The pilots contacted Frobisher Flight Service Station (FSS) at 22:31 reporting at 6000 feet altitude estimating Frobisher in 15 minutes. Upon receiving the latest weather indicating conditions below VFR limits, they requested clearance for ""Special VFR"". This clearance was granted.Another weather report was transmitted by the Frobisher FSS giving the 22:44 observation in which the ceiling had lowered to 400 ft with the visibility at 8 miles and the wind from 190 deg M at 22 knots.The pilot stated they would make a front course ILS approach to runway 36 with a landing on 18. At 22:58 they were issued a clearance for an ILS approach. They subsequently reported outbound at procedure turn altitude and at that time confirmed their planned approach for runway 36 with circling for 18. This was the last radio transmission from C-GROW.The Twin Otter was seen flying north along the runway. It then struck high ground about 1200 feet east of the runway and about 100 feet above runway level.It is quite possible that there was low cloud over the terrain east of the runway; when the aircraft had nearly completed its turn, it entered low cloud and the crew lost visual contact; the crew continued the right turn probably expecting to become visual again because they knew that good visibility existed over the runway; they did not regain contact with the ground and runway environment however and impacted the higher ground to the east of the runway."
511,ACC485,"The plane entered thick fog en route from Comox Airport, BC (YQQ) to Port Hardy Airport, BC (YZT) and flew into a wooded hillside."
512,ACC486,Visibility at Bettles was very poor due to blowing snow and a low ceiling. DC-3 N99663 was on finals during a localiser DME approach when it struck three parked aircraft 50 feet to the right of the runway.
515,ACC489,"Weather in the Big Trout Lake area was poor; another aircraft in the area reported 1/8 mile visibility. The Twin Otter continued and approached the NDB tower, which it should have passed at 2000 feet amsl. The aircraft, however, struck the tower (or supporting wires) at 126 feet and crashed into the adjacent lake."
517,ACC491,"The aircraft flew about 6 km beyond the destination and was observed entering Hawabanga (or Huabango) valley at a very low altitude, and at least 1500 feet below the cloud base.The height at which the aircraft entered, a safe turn around to exit the valley was beyond the performance capability of the aircraft. It struck trees in a steep banking attitude and crashed.Three persons, all of them passengers including a missionary, Brother Steven Richmond, were killed and seven others including the pilot, Phil Anderson, were injured. The pilot was mking his first solo flight on the accident route."
518,ACC492,"The Yak-40 was approaching Vologda in fog. Although visibility was reported 1500 m, the actual visibility was 700 meters, which was below airport minima.The airplane descended below decision height without having established ground contact and touched tops of trees at 20 m and crashed in a wood, cutting a swath of 204 m. It disintegrated and caught fire. Reportedly wrong information on visibility was intentionally transmitted to allow the arrival of three Yak-40 planes."
519,ACC493,"Struck high ground in bad weather while descending for an instrument approach to Ushuaia Airport, TF (USH), Argentina.Among those killed was YPF President Raúl Ondarts."
522,ACC496,"Flight PK740 departed Jeddah at 01:29 for a flight to Karachi. The aircraft was climbing to FL370 when, at 01:47, a stewardess reported a fire near the aft cabin passenger door. The crew started a descent from FL300 and were cleared to descend to 4000 feet. Following a mayday call at 02:03 nothing more was heard from the flight. The aircraft crashed in a level rocky area at an elevation of 3000 feet and burst into flames."
523,ACC497,"In 1977 Air New Zealand received permission from the Director of Civil Aviation to conduct scenic charter flights overflying Antarctica in the McMurdo area, using DC-10 airliners.Flight crews that operated these flights received a dedicated route qualification briefing which included the route that was to be flown and the operational limits regarding a.o. altitude and visibility.Nineteen days before the planned departure of flight TE901, both pilots received this briefing during which diagrams and maps were issued that depicted a track which passed to the true west of Ross Island over a sea level ice shelf. Subsequently the airline discovered that the IFR computer stored flight plan route contained the wrong destination coordinates with an error of 2° in longitude. This was changed just prior to departure of flight 901. The flight crew thus assumed they would be able to descend over a sea level ice shelf, whereas the corrected route would take the aircraft straight towards the turning point over Williams Field Air Base. This route passed direct over Mount Erebus reaching to 12450 feet AMSL. The flight crew programmed their navigation computer using these new coordinates, without having been notified of this change. The aircraft, ZK-NZP, then took off from Auckland International Airport at 19:17 (27 November). The flight progressed normally from Auckland to Antarctica and the weather was clear over Northern Victoria Land. The aircraft was on its planned track and turned over the appropriate point at Cape Hallett to proceed direct towards the next planned waypoint (the TACAN at Williams Field) near McMurdo.During this leg of the flight the weather conditions over McMurdo and Ross Island generally overcast with a ragged cloud base of 3000 feet. The direct flight from Cape Hallett to Williams Field was interrupted some 40 miles true north of McMurdo to take advantage of a hole in the cloud cover, which extended vertically to sea level and to descend the aircraft in this gap prior to its planned arrival near McMurdo. The captain bad been advised that the visibility below the cloud which was over Ross Island, was 40 miles. This descent was made despite the safety requirements to maintain a minimum sector altitude of 16000 feet until overhead McMurdo TACAN and to descend below that height only in a specified sector and in weather conditions of 20 km visibility and no snow showers, and after contacting the radar controller.When flight 901 requested a clearance for a descent from 10000 to 2000 feet on a heading of 180° Grid (i.e. towards the north) and to proceed to McMurdo VMC there was no reason for the Air Traffic Centre staff at McMurdo to question this as it was from a reported position to the true north of Ross Island and therefore the descent would take the aircraft back out over the sea level ice and the flight had confirmed it would maintain VMC inbound to McMurdo.Had the crew followed their stated intention to descend on a heading of 180° grid they would have increased their safety margin from the high ground, but without further advice to McMurdo Centre the pilot in command reversed the aircrafts descent track and from 5800 feet the descent to 2000 feet was completed on a heading of 357° grid back toward the cloud covered high ground. This inbound track had a minimum safe altitude of 16000 feet. After reaching 2000 feet the aircraft captain announced he would descend a further 500 feet to obtain a better view below the continuous cloud layer.The aircraft headed toward the cloud covered island, while the pilots were under the assumptions they were safely over a sea level ice shelf.The captain descended the aircraft a further 500 feet from the original 2000 feet but at 1500 feet and at a distance to run of 26 miles he finally became concerned and stated ""Were 26 miles north, well have to climb out of this"".The weather conditions had a high potential for a whiteout phenomenon due to the overcast conditions above the continuous snow covered slope. After the captains decision to climb the aircraft out of the area he and the co-pilot were discussing the most suitable climbout path when the ground proximity warning system sounded instructing the crew to ""Pull up"". The crew responded to the alarm without undue hesitation, the flight engineer calling off the heights of 500 and 400 feet indicated on the radio altimeter and the captain calling for ""Go-round power"". The warning 6,5 seconds before the impact was, however, too late for the crews action to make any significant effect on the aircrafts level flight path. The ground proximity warning systems alarm was delayed because the terrain closure started from above a coastal cliff 300 feet high instead of a steadily increasing slope which would have triggered the warning approximately 3 seconds earlier. The system has an approximate 6 second delay after it first senses a dangerous closure rate with the terrain below the aircraft. This is to minimise spurious alerts triggered by short steep slopes below the aircraft during normal safe flight paths. The aircraft collided with the ice slope of Mount Erebus on Ross Island at  an elevation of 1467 feet AMSL and immediately started to break up. A fire was initiated on impact and a persistent fire raged in the fuselage cabin area after that section came to rest."
525,ACC499,"The aircraft went missing while on a VFR flight along the coastline to Shishmaref. Marginal VFR to IFR weather with icing conditions below 10.000 feet. The search for the plane was called off on December 19. The wreckage was finally recovered February 10, 1980."

531,ACC505,"An Antonov 24 passenger plane, operated by Aeroflot's Krasnoyarsk Division, was damaged beyond repair in an emergency landing accident at Krasnoyarsk Airport (KJA), Russia. Two passengers were killed. The right main landing gear was damaged during the takeoff run at Krasnoyarsk Airport (KJA) and did not retract. The aircraft burnt fuel and returned to the airport for an emergency landing on a grass/dirt strip at the airport.Some 70 metres after touchdown the right main gear broke off and later on the right central wing section was damaged, causing a fuel spill. A fire erupted. Two passengers exited the airplane on the right hand side and suffered severe burns. Both later died in a hospital."
534,ACC508,"The Il-14 took off for a training flight from the Varadero Airport, Cuba, at 09:56 local time (13:56 UTC). Eighteen minutes later the flight reported level at 6500 feet.As the flightcrew began practicing stalls, the aircraft entered into a left-hand spin and the crew was unable to recover it. At 10:19 the aircraft was observed descending until it crashed offshore."
535,ACC509,Lost control after encountering clear air turbulence at FL430. The Learjet had exceeded its Mach limits when the pilots responded to the encounter. The Mach overspeed warning horn had been disconnected with an unauthorized cut-off switch.
536,ACC510,"A TAAG Angola Airlines Yak-40 passenger plane crashed near Matala in Angola, killing all 19 on board. Flight International reports that the airplane operated on a domestic flight from Jamba (JMB) to Lubango (SDD). Angolan authorities reported to ICAO that flight took off at 15:15. At 15:32 the aircraft went down when it was hit following 'actions by a foreign aircraft'. The airplane then crashed near Matala, killing all 19 on board. Since Matala is located at some 155 km east of Lubango, it seems more likely that the accident flight was routed from Lubango to Jamba.Unconfirmed reports suggest that the Yak-40 may have been shot down by a Zambian Shenyang J-6 (MiG-19) fighter plane."
537,ACC511,"En route from Leninabad (now Khudzhand) to Dushanbe the crew deviated from their course by 67 km in order to avoid thunderstorm activity. They then reported passing a beacon while they where actually 37 km from that beacon. The air traffic controller cleared the flight to descend from 6000 m to 4800 m. Then the crew has reported passing the outer marker at the prescribed height, while the plane was actually 43 km from the beacon. The controller cleared the flight down to 3600 m. The crew continued their descent and carried out the procedure right turn, following which the flight was cleared down to 2100 m. At height of 2840 m the crew noticed that their position was not correct, stopped descend and initiated a left turn. The Yak-40 entered clouds and struck the slope of a mountain, 44 km NW of the airport.It appeared that the radio compass did not work properly due to the proximity of the thunderstorm and the wind was different than forecast."
539,ACC513,The aircraft crashed into a soybean field shortly after takeoff from runway 22.
541,ACC515,"An Embraer 110P1 Bandeirante was destroyed when it crashed near Tepic, Mexico. All 13 on board were killed.The airplane operated on an air ambulance flight from Tepic, carrying ten patients and a nurse. It flew into the side of a hill some three minutes after takeoff from Tepic."

550,ACC524,"Flight SV163 landed at Riyadh at 16:06 GMT for a scheduled intermediate stop after a flight from Karachi. At 18:08 the aircraft took off for the final leg to Jeddah. Six minutes and 54 seconds after takeoff, while climbing to FL350, visual and aural warnings indicated smoke in the aft cargo compartment C-3. Climbing through FL220 (at 18:20), a return to Riyadh was initiated. About two minutes later smoke was noted in the aft of the cabin, and passengers were panicking. At 18:25:26 the no. 2 engine throttle was stuck. The fire had by then entered the cabin of the TriStar. Because passengers where fighting in the aisles, aft of doors L2 and R2, the captain asked everybody to remain seated (18:27:40). On final approach engine no. 2 was shut down, and the captain told the cabin crew not to evacuate. Flight SV163 landed back at Riyadh runway 01 at 18:36:24 The crew continued to a taxiway and told the tower that they were going to shut the engines down and evacuate. The engines were shut down at 18:42:18. Because no evacuation had been initiated by then, crash, fire and rescue personnel tried to open the doors. At about 19:05 they succeeded in opening door 2R. About three minutes later, the interior was seen to be engulfed in flames. None of the occupants survived the fire."

The aircraft had departed Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and was enroute to Karachi, Pakistan. An emergency descent was initiated and a successful landing was made at Doha International Airport in Qatar. Two passengers were killed when they were ejected from the aircraft through a hole in the cabin floor which had resulted from the forces of explosive decompression."
562,ACC536,"Prior to reaching Peshawar, the hijackers reported to be armed with pistols and explosives required that the aircraft divert to Kabul. Afghanistan.They claimed to belong to a group opposed to the current Pakistan government and they demanded the release of a large number of persons being held by the Pakistani government. They threatened to blow up the plane and/or shoot the passengers if their demands were not met. Over the next several days some of the passengers were released and one male passenger was shot and thrown off the aircraft. He died later. On March 8, the aircraft flew to Damascus. Syria. Several deadlines were set and passed without incident or were extended. The hijackers more than once changed their demands as to the number of persons they wanted released. Finally they settled on 55 and Pakistan agreed when the hijackers threatened to shoot the U.S. citizens aboard. On March 14 after the Libyans refused to allow them to land 54 of the 55 were flown to Syria. The hijackers then surrendered. This hijacking lastedapproximately 12 days and 10 hours, the longest to date."
563,ACC537,The flight departed Batagay at 11:43 despite forecast icing conditions. En route the flight encountered snow squalls while over mountainous terrain at 1500 m altitude. The airplane began to descend until it struck a cloud-shrouded mountainside at an elevation of 860 m.

574,ACC548,"The Fairchild C-119 airtanker was dispatched from Goleta, CA at 08:57, heading for a fire burning on the Los Padres National Forest. The airtanker arrived at the fire location and was given direction for the drop by the Incident Commander (IC). The IC instructed the airtanker pilots to keep the drop high because of steep terrain and snags. They were also instructed to drop only one-half the retardant, saving the remainder for another run. The airtanker pilots acknowledged the instructions.The airtanker pilots notified the IC that they were on final approach. As the airtanker approached the intended drop area, the IC noted from the sound of the engines that they were ""revved up."" He also heard cracking and popping sounds. When the airtanker came into his sight, the IC and another person noticed that the drop doors on the airtanker were not open and that the landing gear was retracted.The IC had worked with this airtanker and its crewmembers on several previous occasions. The IC noted that the airtanker was lower than he had expected, traveling at an air speed higher than he had observed on previous drops, and that the airtanker was in a descending attitude. The IC and one other person observed the airtanker continue past the intended drop site and then suddenly drop vertically approximately 50 to 100 feet. At that moment, the left wing tip (approximately half of the total left wing span) flexed downward, snapped off, and began cartwheeling along behind the airtanker. The airtanker began to roll left, its nose began to drop, it began to strike trees, and then it struck ground at 09:27.The captain and copilot were fatally injured upon impact. The aircraft was totally destroyed.Ground investigation confirmed the loss of the left wing prior to impact. Portions of the left wing, left flap, left inboard aileron, and approximately 20 feet of intact left wing tip were recovered between 50 to 800 feet in front of the impact point.Investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and Forest Service teams showed definite pre-mishap cracks in the inner left wing aileron bell crank control assembly. The possibility of a bell crank failure could have induced aileron flutter, which in turn could have contributed to wing destruction causing the wing to separate from the airtanker."
575,ACC549,"While flying at 2000 feet, a catastrophic failure of the no. 2 cylinder caused a no. 1 engine fire. A massive fire of the outboard part of the left wing led to the separation of this part while returning to the airport."

577,ACC551,"The F-27 entered an area of heavy rain in clouds with severe turbulence, eight minutes after takeoff. The aircraft entered a spiral dive after encountering strong vertical gusts. Loads during the dive increased to 5.76 G. These loads exceeded the design stress limits, causing part of the right wing to separate."
578,ACC552,"The Twin Otter departed Rio Hato Airport at 10:44, bound for Penonomé. On board were Panama's president general Omar Torrijos and four of his aides. The aircraft arrived at 10:55 and departed again 45 minutes later for a short flight to Coclecito. Before reaching the destination the airplane flew into the side of Marta Mountain at an altitude of 3,400ft."
579,ACC553,"The Curtiss C-46, registered CC-CAT was carrying about 6 tons of cargo on a domestic flight from Cochrane Airport (LGR), Chile to Villa O'Higgins.Shortly after takeoff the no. 2 engine failed. The airplane veered to the right and crashed into the side of a hill. Captain of the airplane was Óscar Squella Avendaño, a well known Chilean aviator."
580,ACC554,"Yakovlev 40 CCCP-87346 operated on the domestic route Irkutsk ­ Chita ­ Zeya ­ Blagoveshchensk. The airplane departed Chita at 18:20 and arrived near Zeya some two hours later. Weather was poor (drizzle and fog) as the flight approached Zeya. Descent was continued below minimum descent altitude, even after the GPWS sounded. The crew continued the descent without visual contact with the ground until the airplane collided with treetops about 350 m from the runway threshold and 125 m right of its extended centerline. The Yak-40 crashed and caught fire."
585,ACC559,"An NLM Cityhopper Fokker F-28 Fellowship was destroyed when it crashed in an industrial area near Moerdijk, Netherlands. All 17 on board were killed.The aircraft, named ""Eindhoven"", operated flight HN431 from Rotterdam Airport, Netherlands to Eindhoven, Netherlands and Hamburg, Germany. During the weather briefing at Rotterdam Airport, 44 minutes before takeoff, the crew was told about the presence of an area with thunderstorms to the south and east of Rotterdam. At 17:04 hours local time the F-28 took off from Rotterdam Airport. About five minutes after takeoff the crew noted heavy rainfall in thunderstorms on the weather avoidance radar and received clearance to avoid this area. Course was changed to the south in order to pass between two major thunderstorm cores.At 17:12 the aircraft entered a tornado, which resulted in loads on the airframe increasing to +6.8 G and -3,2 G. The right wing was bent upwards followed by a severe downward sweep. This compromised the structural integrity of the wing, causing a large portion of the outer wing to separate in an upward and rearward motion. Control was lost and the aircraft impacted a railway bridge inverted."
586,ACC560,"While on approach to Noril'sk, the plane acquired an excessive vertical speed and descended below the glideslope. It impacted terrain in an open field about 470 m from the runway threshold and slid across the frozen ground for about 300 m. The Tu-154 had a high descent speed, maximum forward centre of gravity and slow flying speed. The high descent speed could not be countered by applying maximum elevator trim."

600,ACC574,"Widerøe Flight 933 was a scheduled domestic service from Kirkenes Airport, Norway to Alta Airport, with intermediate stops at Vadsø Airport, Berlevåg Airport, Mehamn Airport and Honningsvåg Airport. The Twin Otter left Berlevåg at 13:19 hours on the third leg of the flight. The first officer reported to Mehamn Aerodrome Flight Information Service (AFIS) at 13:22 that the aircraft was at 2,000 feet altitude over the Tanafjord and had an estimated time of arrival of 13:33. Mehamn AFIS radioed Flight 933 at 13:35, but received no answer. The aircraft failed to arrive at was declared missing.The wreckage was located two days after the accident at a depth of 45 meters in the water off Gamvik, Norway.The investigation into the cause of the accident concluded that the vertical stabilizer failed in flight in strong turbulent wind conditions.The accident occurred during a NATO military exercise, within a self-declared no-fly zone for allied military aircraft. A report in 1987 that radar had observed an unidentified aircraft which was on a collision course with the Twin Otter caused a second investigation to be started. It was concluded that the existence of other aircraft in the area could be ruled out; and that no other airborne objects could have caused the accident.The debate about the accident resurfaced in 1997 when several sources claimed there was new or overlooked evidence of the involvement of NATO aircraft. The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) decided in 1997 to investigate the new claims and concluded that there was no evidence to support these claims.The accident was ordered investigated again in November 2002 after a retired Norwegian air traffic controller said one of the Harrier pilots, involved in a mission about the time of the accident, had requested an immediate landing because of technical problems. The report was published on 20 September 2005. It fully supported the findings of all three previous reports and found no evidence for an impact with a Harrier or any other aircraft."
603,ACC577,"The Dornier 228-100 prototype, registration D-IFNS, was destroyed when it crashed during a test flight. All three crew members, a Dornier test pilot and two U.K. CAA pilots were killed in the accident.The flight was part of the UK Civil Aviation Authority's certification programme for the type.

An intermediate stop was made at Rostov (ROV) where new-year fir trees were loaded. The takeoff weight was above the maximum allowed. The airplane took off in conditions of thick fog. When the flaps were retracted on climbout, the aircraft descended during some 7-8 seconds with a vertical descent rate of up to 17 m/s. The crew were able to pull up but it was too late. The airplane contacted pine trees on a small hill, crashed and burned."
631,ACC605,"The aircraft was on a corporate flight from Philadelphia International Airport, USA, to Toronto International Airport when it crashed, 7.6. nm from the threshold of runway 24R while being vectored for an ILS approach.The aircraft was observed to descend steeply from cloud and execute a series of abrupt, rolling movements, before striking the ground in a nose low, inverted attitude. A severe fire followed. The two crew members and three passengers die in the crash.The investigators noted that there are indications of a pre-impact internal failure in the low pressure compressor of the right engine. The cause of this could not be determined. There are also indications that the left engine was flamed out and windmilling at impact. The cause of this could not be determined.It was also noted that wing anti-ice was not operating at impact, while icing conditions were present along the flight path of N99S as it descended and approached the localizer."
633,ACC607,"Northwest flight NW608 was en route between Seattle/Tacoma, WA and Portland, OR when it was hijacked by a male passenger. The hijacker Informed a flight attendant he had a bomb in a box he was holding and demanded to be flown to Afghanistan. The hijacker agreed to land at Portland, Oregon to refuel, and shortly after landing, negotiations were initiated. While the hijacker was otherwise engaged, federal agents boarded the aircraft through a cockpit window. When confronted, the hijacker threw the box at the agents and one of the agents fired one shot which killed the hijacker. The box was examined and found to contain no explosives."
635,ACC609,"While enroute to Kabul, the weather deteriorated. The pilot chose to climb to FL185 and continue VFR.

The aircraft was cleared to descend to 900 m when it struck a cloud-shrouded mountainside at a height of 2523 m.ATC didn't determine the position of the aircraft and didn't require the aircraft to circle at a safe altitude for identification."
644,ACC618,"Air Canada Flight 797, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32, was a scheduled flight from Dallas (DFW) to Montreal, Canada, with an en route stop at Toronto (YYZ).At 16:25 CDT, Flight 797 left Dallas and climbed to FL330. Except for a deviation to the south of their filed flight plan route to avoid weather, the flight progressed without incident until it entered the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center's (ARTCC) airspace.At 18:51:14 EDT, the three circuit breakers associated with the aft lavatory's flush motor and located on a panel on the cockpit wall behind the captain's seat, tripped in rapid succession. After identifying the circuit breakers, the captain immediately made one attempt to reset them; the circuit breakers would not reset. The captain assumed that the flush motor had probably seized and took no further action at this time. About 18:59:58, the captain again unsuccessfully tried to reset the three circuit breakers. He told the first officer that the circuit breaker ""Pops as I push it."" About 19:00, a passenger seated in the last row asked a flight attendant to identify a strange odor. The flight attendant thought the odor was coming from the aft lavatory. She took a CO2 fire extinguisher from the cabin wall and opened the lavatory door a few inches. She saw that a light gray smoke had filled the lavatory from the floor to the ceiling, but she saw no flames. While she was inspecting the lavatory, she inhaled some smoke and closed the door. The No.3 flight attendant then saw the No.2 flight attendant nearby and asked her to tell the flight attendant in charge of the situation. Upon being advised there was a fire, the flight attendant in charge instructed the No. 2 flight attendant to inform the captain and then to assist the No. 3 flight attendant in moving the passengers forward and in opening the eyebrow air vents over the passenger seats to direct air to the rear of the cabin. The flight attendant in charge then took the CO extinguisher and opened the lavatory door about three-quarters open. He also saw no flames, but he observed thick curls of black smoke coming out of the seams of the aft lavatory walls at the top of the wash basin behind the vanity and at the ceiling. He then proceeded ""to saturate the washroom with CO'' by spraying the paneling and the seam from which smoke was seeping and spraying the door of the trash bin. He then closed the lavatory door.At 19:02:40, the No. 2 flight attendant reached the cockpit and told the captain, ""Excuse me, there's a fire in the washroom in the back, they're just ... went back to go to put it out."" Upon being notified of the fire, the captain ordered the first officer to inspect the lavatory. The captain then donned his oxygen mask and selected the 100-percent oxygen position on his regulator. The first officer left the cockpit but did not take either smoke goggles or a portable oxygen bottle with him. (The airplane was not equipped with nor was it required to be equipped with self-contained breathing equipment or a full face smoke mask.) The first officer said that he could not get to the aft lavatory because the smoke, which had migrated over the last three to four rows of seats, was too thick. The flight attendant in charge told the first officer what he had seen when he opened the lavatory door, that he had discharged the CO2 extinguisher into the lavatory, and that he had not been able to see the source of the smoke before closing the door. He told the first officer, however, that he did not believe the fire was in the lavatory's trash container. The first officer told the flight attendant in charge that he was going forward to get smoke goggles. At 19:04:07, the first officer returned to the cockpit and told the captain that the smoke had prevented him from entering the aft lavatory and that he thought ""we'd better go down."" He did not tell the captain that the flight attendant in charge had told him that the fire was not in the trash bin. However, at 19:04:16, before the captain could respond, the flight attendant in charge came to the cockpit and told the captain that the passengers had been moved forward and that the captain didn't ""have to worry, I think its gonna be easing up."" The first officer looked back into the cabin and said that it was almost clear in the back. He told the captain, ""it's starting to clear now,"" and that he would go aft again if the captain wanted him to do so. According to the captain, the first officer's smoke goggles were stored in a bin on the right side of the cockpit and were not easily accessible to the first officer while he was not in his seat. Since the first officer needed the goggles and since there was a hurry, the captain gave him his goggles and, at 19:04:46, directed him to go aft.Two minutes later, while the first officer was out of the cockpit, the flight attendant in charge told the captain again that the smoke was clearing. The captain believed the fire was in the lavatory trash bin and decided not to descend at this time because he ""expected it (the fire) to be put out."" About 19:05:35, while the first officer was still aft to inspect the aft lavatory, the airplane experienced a series of electrical malfunctions. The master caution light illuminated, indicating that the airplane's left a.c. and d.c. electrical systems had lost power.In the meanwhile, the first officer proceeded to the aft lavatory and put on the smoke goggles. The lavatory door felt hot to the touch, so he decided not to open it and instructed the cabin crew to leave it closed. At that time, he noticed a flight attendant signaling him to hurry back to the cockpit. The first officer returned to the cockpit and got into his seat, and at 19:07:11, he told the captain, ""I don't like what's happening, I think we better go down, okay?"" Then the master warning light illuminated and the annunciator lights indicated that the emergency a.c. and d.c. electrical buses had lost power. The captain's and first officer's attitude directional indicators tumbled. The captain ordered the first officer to activate the emergency power switch, thereby directing battery power to the emergency a.c. and d.c. buses. The attitude directional indicators' gyros began erecting, however, because of the loss of a.c. power, the stabilizer trim was inoperative and remained so during the rest of the flight. At 19:08:12, Flight 797 called the radar high sector controller at Indianapolis Center: ""Mayday, Mayday, Mayday."" The Louisville radar high sector controller acknowledged the call, and at 19:08:47, the flight told the controller that it had a fire and was going down. The controller told the flight that it was 25 nautical miles from Cincinnati and asked ""can you possibly make Cincinnati."" The flight answered that it could make Cincinnati and then requested clearance; it was then cleared to descend to 5,000 feet. At 19:09:05, Flight 797 reported that it was leaving FL330. The flight then told the controller that it needed to be vectored toward Cincinnati, that it was declaring an emergency, and that it had changed its transponder code to 7700 -- the emergency code. However, the transponder was inoperative due to the power loss.The Louisville radar high sector controller directed the flight to turn to 060 degrees and told it that the Greater Cincinnati Airport was at ""twelve o'clock at twenty miles."" The Indianapolis Center's Lexington low altitude D (LEX-D) controller then called the approach controller at the Cincinnati Airport's Terminal Radar Control (TRACON) facility to alert him of an impending handoff in his southwest sector and later told the Cincinnati approach controller that he had ""an emergency for you, Air Canada seven nine seven."" The approach controller replied, ""Zero six six two, thirty-five thousand."" Zero six six two was the code assigned to Continental 383, a westbound flight at FL350. At 19:09:33, the LEX-D controller answered, ""Yeah, thirty-three right now, he's twenty-five southwest."" The approach controller replied, ""Radar contact, okay."" However, when the approach controller accepted the handoff of Flight 797, he had mistaken the radar beacon target of Continental Flight 383 as that of Flight 797. Shortly after he had accepted the handoff, the approach controller had notified the Cincinnati Airport tower local controller that he intended to land an Air Canada jet with an on board fire on runway 36. The tower's local controller alerted the airport fire station, and crash-fire-rescue (CFR) vehicles were dispatched and positioned for an emergency landing. The firefighters had also been advised that the airplane had electrical problems, that smoke was coming from the aft lavatory, and that there was smoke or fire in the rear of the airplane. At 19:10:01, almost coincident with the end of his message to the local controller, the LEX-D controller informed the approach controller of Flight 797's assigned 060° heading. At 19:10:25, Flight 797 contacted the Cincinnati approach controller, declared an emergency, and said that it was descending. The approach controller acknowledged and told the flight to plan for a runway 36 instrument landing system (ILS) approach and requested the flight to turn right to 090 degrees. He then realized the target he was observing was not responding and attempted unsuccessfully to assign a discrete transponder code to it in order to track it better. Thereafter, at 19:10:48, Flight 797 reported that it had a fire in its aft lavatory and that the cabin was filling with smoke. The controller asked the flight to ""say the type airplane, number of people on board, and amount of fuel (on board)."" The first officer answered that he would supply this data later because ""I don't have time now."" At 19:12:40, the approach controller called the Evansville/Nabb D controller on the landline to request assistance. Almost simultaneous with the call, he also observed an eastbound primary target and began to monitor it. At 19:12:44, the flight requested the cloud ceiling at the airport and the controller responded that the ceiling was ""two thousand five hundred scattered, measure(d) eight thousand feet overcast, visibility one two (12) miles with light rain."" The controller then decided that the eastbound target was Flight 797, and at 19:12:54, he requested the flight to ""say altitude."" Based on the target's position -- about 3 nmi east of runway 36's extended centerline and about 8 nmi south of its threshold -- and its reported altitude of 8,000 feet, that it was too high and too fast to land on runway 36. He decided to use runway 27L for landing, and used the primary target to monitor the flight and vector it toward the airport. At 19:13:38, after Flight 797 was unable to tell him its heading because its heading instruments were inoperative, the approach controller asked the flight to turn left. The controller said that this was an identification turn and that it was also designed to place the airplane closer to the airport. He then told the flight that this was a ""no gyro"" radar approach for runway two seven left ... If and cleared it to descend to 3,500 feet. He then told the flight that it was 12 nmi southeast of the Cincinnati Airport, cleared it to land on runway 27L, and informed it that the surface wind was 220 degrees at 4 knots. He informed the tower of the change of landing runways and the tower directed the fire department to position its vehicles along runway 27L. At 19:15:11, Flight 797 reported that it was level at 2,500 feet."" The approach controller vectored the flight to runway 27L, and at 19:15:58, told it that it was 12 nmi from the airport. The flight descended to 2,000 feet, and the controller continued to supply range calls.When the captain sighted the runway, he extended the landing gear. Since the horizontal stabilizer was inoperative, the captain extended the flaps and slats incrementally through the 0, 5, 15, 25, and 40-degree positions. He allowed his indicated airspeed to stabilize at each flap position as he slowed to approach speed. He flew the final approach at 140 KIAS and completed the landing. After touchdown, he made a maximum effort stop using extended spoilers and full brakes. Because of the loss of the left and right a.c. buses, the antiskid system was inoperative and the four main wheel tires blew out. The airplane was stopped just short of the intersection of taxiway J. After the captain completed the emergency engine shutdown checklist, both he and the first officer attempted to go back into the cabin and assist in the passenger evacuation, but were driven back by the smoke and heat. Thereafter, they exited the airplane through their respective cockpit sliding windows. After the airplane stopped, the left (L-1) and right (R-1) forward cabin doors, the left forward (L-2) overwing exit, and the right forward (R-2) and aft (R-3) overwing exits were opened, and the slides at the L-1 and R-1 doors were deployed and inflated. The 3 cabin attendants and 18 passengers used these 5 exits to evacuate the airplane. After the 18 passengers and 5 crewmembers left the airplane, the cabin interior burst into flames. Twenty-three passengers perished in the fire. Neither the passengers, crew, nor witnesses outside of the airplane saw flames inside the cabin before the survivors left the plane. The fuselage and passenger cabin were gutted before airport fire personnel could extinguish the fire."

665,ACC639,"A DHC-6 Twin Otter passenger plane, operated by Austin Airways, was damaged beyond repair in an accident near Lansdowne House Airport, ON (YLH).There were 2 crew and 5 passengers on board of which 4 passengers were asphyxiated in the post crash fire. The 1 surviving passenger suffered serious injuries and the crew escaped with minor or no injuries.The airplane operated on a domestic flight from Sandy Lake Airport, ON (ZSJ). Visibility at Lansdowne House was poor due to heavy snow snowfallAfter executing an overshoot, the captain flew a second circuit without losing sight of the airfield. The aircraft turned toward the runway. The pilot called 'runway in sight' and shortly thereafter, the co-pilot noticed the radio altimeter pass through 200 feet. Moments before impact, the captain reported to the 1st officer that he was encountering whiteout conditions and moved to advance the power levers.The aircraft was in line with the runway when it struck the snow-covered ice surface of the lake, about 1200 feet short of the runway threshold. The nose gear assembly was broken off at first impact. The aircraft then slid and rotated 180 degrees counter clockwise, struck large rocks on the shore and stopped 600 feet short of the runway.The rear spars of each wing were separated from the fuselage; the fuel tanks were ruptured and the fuel lines were broken. Fire broke out on impact."
666,ACC640,"A Fokker F-28 Fellowship 2000 passenger jet, registered 5N-ANF, was damaged beyond repair in an accident 3,3 km from Enugu Airport (ENU), Nigeria. There were 66 passengers and six crew members on board. The airplane operated on a Nigeria Airways flight from Lagos/Ikeja International Airport (LOS) to Enugu Airport (ENU).A VOR approach was attempted although the airport visibility was reported to be below minima. While first maintaining MDA at or below 300 ft above local terrain and apparently manoeuvring to regain track while passing the VOR, the aircraft was suddenly made to descend, less than two miles short of the threshold. The aircraft was still in approach configuration. At initial impact, which was in a nearly level attitude in flat terrain covered with high grass, the landing gears were torn off or collapsed. The aircraft then slid on its belly, while shedding pieces, into a cassavaterrain consisting of a regular pattern of mounds of about 1 metre high and some trees. One of these trees cut the left wing slightly outboard of the root collector tank and the wing separated further on. The left engine and nacelle were torn off as well, including a large piece of side wall, floor structure and aft pressure bulkhead. Aft fuselage and empennage further separated behind the pressure bulkhead. In view of the damage to the aft fuselage parts, it is likely that the aircraft travelled in a taildown nose-high attitude during some part of the ground slide.The front fuselage bottom was severely compressed, the cargo holds were ruptured and their contents dispersed. Due to the right wing trailing on the mounds and hitting some smaller trees, the final slide relative to the fuselage was sideward to the left.A fire erupted at the separated wing and engine and gradually made its way towards the fuselage remains."
668,ACC642,"Weather conditions for Paulatuk included a strong crosswind at 25-30 knots and blowing snow. The pilot attempted to carry out an overshoot, but the left wing contacted the ground and the aircraft cartwheeled. This happened during a transition from visual to instrument flight. The aircraft was overloaded by 840 lb."
671,ACC645,"During the descent into Izhevsk Airport (IJK), Russia, the Antonov 24 suffered an elevator control failure. The crew attempted to use the elevator trim during their approach.The first approach was flown at a speed of 270 km/h and flaps at 15° but the crew decided to abandon the approach because the nose pitched up. The second approach was flown at 250 km/h. flaps 15° and the elevator trim tab at +15°. The airplane fell to the right at a height of 3-5 m on finals and collided with the ground near the runway. The investigation revealed that a nut of the elevator controls had not been attached correctly during maintenance. In service the nut loosened until the controls failed several days later."
673,ACC647,"The aircraft was engaged on a night freighter service from Cairns (CNS) to Brisbane (BNE) with intermediate stops at Townsville (TSV) and Proserpine (PPP). The flight departed Cairns at 18:47 hours. After arriving at Townsville the aircraft was refuelled and additional freight loaded before departing for Proserpine at 19:47 hours. The aircraft was cleared to track direct to Proserpine on climb to FL250. At 20:08 hours the pilot reported that the aircraft had left FL250 on descent into Proserpine and requested a clearance to track to intercept the 310 omni radial inbound for a DME Arrival. This request was approved and a short time later the aircraft reported established on the radial. At 20:16 hours, in answer to a question from Townsville Control, the aircraft reported at 2600 feet and was instructed to call Townsville Flight Service Unit. The aircraft complied with this instruction, and after the initial contact no further transmissions were received from the aircraft. The wreckage was located approximately 4 kilometres north-west of the threshold of runway 11 and in line with that runway. The aircraft had been destroyed by impact forces and the ensuing fire. A witness, who lived near the final approach path of the aircraft, reported that she observed the aircraft when it was on final approach. Analysis of her observations indicated that when she sighted the aircraft it was at a lower height than normal for the type of approach that the pilot reported would be flown. At the time of the sighting she did not notice anything unusual about the operation of the aircraft. Other persons at the Proserpine Aerodrome at the time of the accident reported rainstorms and strong winds in the vicinity. An inspection of the aircraft and its systems did not reveal any defect that could have contributed to the accident. Despite the extensive investigation, no evidence could be found to indicate why the aircraft was below the normal glide path during the approach."
676,ACC650,The F-27 crashed in the jungle.
685,ACC659,"While turning from base leg onto final approach the fight controls suddenly collapsed forward and the nose of the aircraft pitched up. The pilot tried to maintain control by using throttle and flap control. The Twin Otter then collided with the terminal building and a vehicle. It appeared that the elevator control cable was rusted and broken at Station 376 and the cable pulley in the area was also damaged. The cable hadn't been inspected for 725.9 hours, while inspection is required every 700 hours. The corrosion process was speeded up by the fact that the aircraft was operated in a high humidity and marine salt environment. The aircraft had also carried large amounts of salt pork and corned beef in the aft cargo compartment, directly above the corroded cable area."
687,ACC661,"The Varsity aircraft was a twin engined training aircraft used by the Royal Air Force until 1974 when it was sold into private ownership. It was currently owned and operated by an aircraft preservation group who maintained the aircraft to its service specification. For this reason it carried the military designation ""WJ897"" on the fuselage and wings although it was registered as G-BDFT. The aircraft had been granted a Permit to Fly and was restricted to display and demonstration flying and the practising for such displays. Thirteen members of the society had boarded the aircraft earlier that morning at RAF Syerston in Nottinghamshire, where the aircraft was hangared, for the short flight to East Midlands Airport (EMA). This flight was uneventful and, after landing, the aircraft was refuelled with 436 imperial gallons of aviation gasoline (Avgas 100 LL) increasing the total fuel on board to 510 imp gals.It was intended to fly to Liverpool Airport (LPL) to take part in an air display that afternoon. It was arranged that aerial photographs of the Varsity would be taken during the flight to Liverpool using a Cessna 180. This aircraft was to rendezvous with the Varsity at 3000 feet amsl in the area of Blithfield Reservoir some 20 miles to the west of East Midlands Airport. The Varsity engines were normally started using a ground electrical supply. On this occasion, the left engine was reluctant to start and after it initially fired, it faltered and stopped, emitting smoke from the exhaust. For fear of exhausting the batteries with repeated attempts to start, the right engine was started first. The left engine was then motored over before another start attempt was made, this time successfully. The passengers on the Varsity were told that the left engine had been over primed on the first attempt to start.The Varsity took off at 09:32 and the approach controller at East Midlands Airport provided bearing and range information to the Varsity pilot to help him locate the Cessna 180 and, at 09:47 hrs, both aircraft changed to a discrete radio frequency. The Varsity was then flown in formation on the right hand side of the Cessna in a series of wide orbits of the Blithfield Reservoir. During this time, the left engine of the Varsity was seen to emit occasional puffs of smoke accompanied by loud bangs. When the photographer requested that the Varsity climb slightly above the Cessna and lower its undercarriage, the Varsity pilot reported that he was having trouble with the right engine. The Cessna pilot replied that it looked to him as if the problem was in fact with the left engine, as he could see puffs of smoke as if the engine were running too rich. When the Varsity pilot replied that it might be engine icing, the Cessna pilot noted that his intake temperature was indicating in the range where there was no risk of intake icing on his engine. The undercarriage of the Varsity was lowered briefly before being retracted again with the pilot's comment that he ""could not accept the drag and might have to abort the photography"". Towards the end of the photographic flying, the right engine started to backfire as well.At 10:05, the Varsity pilot called East Midlands Airport on the approach frequency requesting a direct return to the airport because he had some engine problems and might have to declare an emergency. In reply the approach controller passed the Varsity a course to steer to East Midlands and asked whether the Varsity could maintain height. The pilot answered that ""at the present we are able to but it's with some difficulty"". The Varsity steadily losing height and, at 10:07, the pilot informed the controller that the left engine of the Varsity had stopped. Thirty seconds later the Varsity co-pilot radioed ""we're going to have to put it down in the nearest field, we're down to 400 feet and losing power on both engines so we are going into the..."". The undercarriage of the Varsity was lowered and, at a very low height, the left wing was then seen to drop and the aircraft rolled over, the nose dropped and it crashed inverted. Just before impact the left mainplane severed 11,000 volt electricity supply wires. As the aircraft broke-up on impact, the rear part of the fuselage together with the empennage fell into a drainage ditch some 10 feet deep. The three survivors were seated in rearward facing seats in this part of the fuselage. Two were able to escape from the fuselage but the third was hampered by a broken leg and received severe burns when a wire fence prevented him from leaving the accident area."
689,ACC663,"Crashed into Mount Musaka.The airplane was on a flight from Tabubil Airport (TBG) in the Western Province, PNG to Telefomin Airport (TFM) in the West Sepik Province, PNG. The flight originated at Wewak Airport (WWK) in the East Sepik Province, PNG. Its final intended destination was Kiunga Airport (UNG) in the Western province were it was based."
690,ACC664,Crashed on takeoff during an aviation event. The aircraft reached a height of only 20 m before it crashed.With 26 passengers the aircraft was overloaded.
691,ACC665,"The aircraft departed Fort Norman at 16:51 and arrived overhead Fort Franklin at approximately 17:15. Because Fort Franklin was shrouded in fog, a local resident contacted the pilot on a portable VHF transceiver and advised him that there was little or no visibility. The pilot replied that he did not think he would be able to land. The resident drove to the airstrip and contacted the pilot again when he heard the aircraft returning. He advised the pilot that visibility was 200-300 feet. The pilot then asked if this was the vertical or horizontal visibility. At that moment the Twin Otter struck a 200-foot-high telecommunications tower while in controlled level fight. Part of the right wing broke off and the aircraft slowly rolled over before striking the ground. The decision of the pilot to continue the approach in foggy weather were possibly influenced by the effects of stress and a greater than usual personal need to complete the flight. The stress was probably caused by the fact that the pilot had been involved in four accidents since March 1984. Although he was a very experienced pilot, his previous employer terminated his employment on 31 August 1984. In their opinion, his ability to make operational decisions was in question. The pilot was hired by Nahanni Air Services one month later."
692,ACC666,"The Twin Otter departed Goose Bay on a medical evacuation flight to St. Anthony. The flight was uneventful and landed in St. Anthony at 15:24. At 16:02, the aircraft departed St. Anthony on a VFR flight back to Goose Bay. On board were the two pilots and the doctor and nurse. Approaching the Goose Bay Airport, weather became marginal, but the crew continued visual flight. The crew likely encountered near zero forward visibility in snow showers and fog; it is probable that they were able to maintain vertical contact with the ground and were confident they could continue flight with visual reference to the ground. The crew may not have been able to see terrain ahead and therefore may not have been able to determine if the aircraft would clear the hills, particularly, when steep hills were encountered. The plane struck a rock outcropping 100 feet below the summit of a 2,050-foot mountain. After bouncing twice, the Twin Otter had come to rest in a small, wooded gully, approximately 350 feet from the initial point of impact."
693,ACC667,"Aeroflot Flight 3352 was a regular domestic service from Krasnodar to Omsk and Novosibirsk, Soviet Union (now Russia).The aircraft, a Tupolev Tu-154B-1, took off from Krasnodar at  23:37 hours Moscow time. At 05:15 local time (02:15 Moscow time), three vehicles were dispatched to the runway at Omsk Airport to carry out work. The vehicles were not equipped with radios that would allow listening to the tower frequency, nor with rotating flashing beacons. Meanwhile, flight 3352 was descending towards Omsk. Visibility was 3000 m, with rain, and haze. Temperature was +3°C and ceiling was measured at 110 m.At 05:33, the landing controller turned on the runway lights. The aircraft touched down at 05:39 hours. Immediately after touching down at a speed of about 140 knots the crew noticed vehicles on the runway. An evasive manoeuvre was of no avail as the aircraft struck three vehicles and a fire erupted. Four occupants of the vehicles and 174 occupants of the aircraft died in the crash.One of the controllers had fallen asleep and thus failed to inform the approach controller about the presence of the vehicles on the runway."
697,ACC671,The Twin Otter flew into a hill near the border with Peru. The airplane carried a dual military serial: FAE-446.
699,ACC673,"After a refueling stop in Dubai (DXB) while en-route to Karachi (KHI), the aircraft was hijacked to Tehran (THR) by four heavily armed Arabs. Over the nextsix days the hijackers released 153 passengers and crew in several groups. The hijackers demanded the release of 17 prisoners, jailed in Kuwait for bomb attacks on U.S. and French installations. While the aircraft was in Tehran, the hijackers beat and tortured at least six passengers and killed two American passengers.Kuwait authorities refused to release the militants from jail. The hijacking ended on December 9, 1984 when Iranian security forces boarded the aircraft and overpowered the hijackers. The hijackers were believed to have been linked to the Iraqi underground organization ""Al Dawa""."
700,ACC674,"A Let L-410MA passenger plane was destroyed when it crashed near Kostroma, Russia. All 15 passengers and two pilots were killed.The airplane was climbing through an altitude of 1500 m after takeoff from Kostroma Airport (KMW) when the artificial horizon failed. The airplane was in clouds and the crew lost spatial orientation. The aircraft entered a descent with increasing bank. At an altitude of 500-600 m it came out of the clouds, allowing the crew to correct the attitude of the aircraft. While pulling out of the dive, the plane went back into the clouds. The crew again lost spatial orientation and the plane now went into a steep dive, rapidly losing altitude. The pilots could not regain control and the airplane struck trees and terrain."
701,ACC675,"At 18:12, flight 1039 was cleared for takeoff from runway 31. At 18:13, while over the departure end of the runway and climbing through 600 feet, the crew acknowledged a frequency change. Thirty seconds later, the airplane was seen in a steep a descent near the extended centerline of the runway. The Bandeirante struck the ground 7,800 feet beyond the departure end of runway 31 and 85 feet to the right of the extended runway centerline in an inverted nose down attitude, after which it caught fire and burned. Before ground impact, the horizontal stabilizer, including bulkhead No. 36, had separated from the fuselage. Both elevators and elevator tips, the tail cone assembly, and the aft portion of the ventral fin also had separated in flight."
702,ACC676,The aircraft was engaged in an IFR training flight from Dar Es Salaam Airport. The flight was to head to Bagamoyo (radial 331/30nm) with a procedure turn at there before returning to Dar Es Salaam Airport where it was to fly an ILS approach.The aircraft went into a spin and crashed. The pilot had lost control possibly due to attention being diverted to a no. 2 engine fire.
703,ACC677,"Two minutes after takeoff, at an altitude of 2040 m, the no. 3 engine suffered an uncontained failure. The no. 3 engine caught fire, but the flight engineer shut down engine no. 2. Some ten seconds later the engineer noticed the error and began attempts to restart engine no. 2. Meanwhile the crew was returning to the airport for an emergency landing. The no. 3 engine was then shut down and extinguishing bottles were fired. This was insufficient to put out the fire. Then the no. 2 engine suddenly spooled up to takeoff power. The engine power levers did not have any effect and the crew shut down the engine but the fuel valve was not closed.Meanwhile, the fire of the engine number 3 spread into the cavity of the pylon and the rear compartment where the APU was located. The fire continued to spread to engine no. 2. With one engine working the airplane passed the Outer Marker at an altitude of 175 m and a speed of 420 km/h.Because of fire damage to the electrical system, the Voltage dropped. The hydraulics failed and the airplane could no longer be controlled. It rolled right and descended at a rate of 10 m/sec. The airplane struck the ground in a 50 degree right bank, four minutes and 30 seconds after the start of the emergency.The reason for failure of engine no. 3 was a fatigue failure of the first stage low pressure compressor disk because of a metallurgical and manufacturing defect."
706,ACC680,"The An-24 stalled and crashed while performing a missed approach in drizzle and fog.One flight attendant and two passengers, who were thrown away from the fuselage when the aircraft crashed onto the ground and disintegrated, survived the post-impact fire and explosion. CAAC Flight 5109 originated in Shanghai and was bound for Beijing with intermediate stops at Nanking and Jinan."
707,ACC681,"An Embraer 110P1 Bandeirante passenger plane, HK-2638, was destroyed in an accident near Buga, Colombia. All 15 passengers and two crew members were killed.AIRES Colombia flight 585 departed Florencia Airport (FLA) on a domestic flight to Cali Airport (CLO), Colombia. An intermediate stop was made at Neiva from were it took off at 09:35. The aircraft crashed into a mountain at 8600 feet after reporting at the Tulua VOR descending to FL105.This same day, ACES lost a DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft also due to VFR flight into IMC conditions."
708,ACC682,"The two ATP rated pilots were en route back to their home base airport flying on an IFR flight plan in actual instrument weather conditions. Communications with ATC controllers was normal. During a night localizer approach into Millville Airport, NJ (MIV), an ATC specialist observed the aircraft passing through the localizer track and issued a vector for re-interception. The aircraft was subsequently observed tracking inbound on course. The pilot reported crossing the OM. This was the last transmission heard from the pilot and was routine. The aircraft crashed into a wooded area just beyond the OM and was destroyed in a post impact fire. Post accident examination of the wreckage revealed evidence to indicate the left engine was producing less power than the right engine at impact."
711,ACC685,"An Antonov 24B passenger plane, operated by Air Mali, was destroyed in an accident near Tombouctou Airport (TOM), Mali. There were 46 passengers and six crew members on board. One passenger survived the accident.The airplane operated on a flight from Gao Airport (GAQ) to Bamako Airport (BKO) with en route stops at Tombouctou and Mopti Airport (MZI).An engine failure after takeoff from Tombouctou, forced the crew to return. The aircraft crashed before being able to reach the airport."
717,ACC691,"During taxi to takeoff the brakes failed. The pilot attempted to groundloop the aircraft, which rolled down hill and collided with a gully. During preflight the co-pilot inadvertently added hydraulic fluid in the alcohol tank. The hydraulic pump cavitated."
718,ACC692,"The Gulfstream I crashed after taking off from runway 20R when the no. 1 engine shut down. The left engine probably shut down because the left lever was found between the 'fuel off' and 'feather' positions, de-activating the autofeather system. The aircraft came to rest 100 feet past the runway end, 1720 feet left of the extended centreline.The aircraft crashed following the application of water-methanol."
723,ACC697,"Aeroflot flight 5143, a Tupolev Tu-154, departed Karshi (KSQ) on a flight to Leningrad (LED) via Ufa (UFA). The flight climbed to the cruising altitude of 11.600 m and maintained an airspeed of 400 km/h, which was close to stall speed under the given conditions. During cruise flight vibrations started because of the low airspeed. The crew assumed that the vibrations were caused by engine surges. They reduced power to flight idle, causing the airspeed to drop to 290 km/h. Trying to maintain altitude, the angle of attack increased until the airplane eventually stalled. The Tu-154 went into a flat spin and crashed."
725,ACC699,"Delta Air Lines flight 191 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Fort Lauderdale, FL (FLL), and Los Angeles, CA (LAX), with an en route stop at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, TX (DFW). Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar airplane, departed Fort Lauderdale on an IFR flight plan with 152 passengers and a crew of 11 on board at 15:10 EDT. The DFW Airport terminal weather forecast contained in the flightcrew's dispatch document package stated, in part, that there was a possibility of widely scattered rain showers and thunderstorms, becoming isolated after 20:00 CDT. The flight was uneventful until passing New Orleans, Louisiana. A line of weather along the Texas-Louisiana gulf coast had intensified. The flightcrew elected to change their route of flight to the more northerly Blue Ridge arrival route to avoid the developing weather to the south. This change necessitated a 10 to 15-minute hold at the Texarkana, Arkansas, VORTAC for arrival sequencing at the DFW Airport. At 17:35, the flightcrew received the following ATIS broadcast: ""DFW arrival information romeo, two one four seven Greenwich, weather six thousand scattered, two one thousand scattered, visibility one zero, temperature one zero one, dew point six seven, wind calm, altimeter two niner niner two, runway one eight right one seven left, visual approaches in progress, advise approach control that you have romeo"". Fort Worth Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) then cleared flight 191 to the Blue Ridge, Texas, VORTAC for the Blue Ridge Nine arrival, and to begin its descent. At 17:43:45, Fort Worth ARTCC cleared flight 191 to descend to 10,000 feet, gave it a 29.92 in Hg altimeter setting, and suggested that the flight turn to a heading-of 250 degrees ""to join the Blue Ridge zero one zero radial inbound and we have a good area there to go through.!' The captain replied that he was looking at a ""pretty good size"" weather cell, ""at a heading of two five five ... and I'd rather not go through it, I'd rather go around it one way or the other."" Fort Worth ARTCC then gave the flight another heading and stated ""when I can I'll turn you into Blue Ridge, it'll be about the zero one zero radial."" At 17:46, the center cleared flight 191 direct to Blue Ridge and to descend to 9,000 feet, and flight 191 acknowledged receipt of the clearance. At 17:48, the captain told the first officer, ""You're in good shape. I'm glad we didn't have to go through that mess. I thought sure he was going to send us through it."" Three minutes later, the flight engineer said, ""Looks like it's raining over Fort Worth."" At 17:51, Forth Worth ARTCC instructed flight 191 to contact DFW Airport Approach Control. At 17:56:28, Regional Approach Control's Feeder East controller transmitted an all aircraft message which was received by flight 191. The message stated in part, ""Attention, all aircraft listening... there's a little rainshower just north of the airport and they're starting to make ILS approaches ... tune up one oh nine one for one seven left."" At 17:59, the first officer stated, ""We're gonna get our airplane washed,"" and the captain switched to Regional Approach Control's Arrival Radar-1 (AR-1) frequency and told the controller that they were at 5,000 feet. At 18:00, the approach controller asked American Air Lines flight 351 if it was able to see the airport. (Flight 351 was two airplanes ahead of flight 191 in the landing sequence for runway 17L.) Flight 351 replied, ""As soon as we break out of this rainshower we will."" The controller then told flight 351 that it was 4 miles from the outer marker, and to join the localizer at 2,300 feet; the controller then cleared the flight for the ILS approach to runway 17L. At 18:00, the approach controller asked flight 191 to reduce its airspeed to 170 knots, and to turn left to 270 degrees; flight 191 then acknowledged receipt of the clearance. Flight 191 had been sequenced behind a Learjet 25 for landing on runway 17L. At 18:02, the approach controller told flight 191 that it was 6 miles from the outer marker, requested that it turn to 180 degrees to join the localizer at or above 2,300 feet, and stated, ""Cleared for ILS one seven left approach."" The flight acknowledged receipt of the transmission. At 18:03:03, the approach controller requested flight 191 ""to reduce your speed to one six zero please,"" and the captain replied, ""Be glad to."" Thereafter, at 18:03:30, he broadcast, ""And we're getting some variable winds out there due to a shower... out there north end of DFW."" This transmission was received by flight 191.At 18:03:46, the approach controller requested flight 191 to slow to 150 KIAS, and to contact the DFW Airport tower. At 18:03:58, the captain, after switching to the tower's radio frequency, stated, ""Tower, Delta one ninety one heavy, out here in the rain, feels good."" The tower cleared the flight to land and informed it, ""wind zero nine zero at five, gusts to one five."" At 18:04:07, the first officer called for the before-landing check. The flightcrew confirmed that the landing gear was down and that the flaps were extended to 33 degrees, the landing flap setting. At 18:04:18, the first officer said, ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, ""What?"" and the first officer repeated ""Lightning coming out of that one."" The captain asked, and at 18:04:23, the first officer replied, ""Right ahead of us."" Flight 191 continued descending along the final approach course. At 18:05:05 the captain called out ""1,000 feet."" At 18:05:19, the captain cautioned the first officer to watch his indicated airspeed and a sound identified as rain began. The captain then warned the first officer, ""You're gonna lose it all of a sudden, there it is."" The captain stated, ""Push it up, push it way up."" At 18:05:29, the sound of engines at high rpm was heard on the CVR, and the captain said ""That's it."" At 18:05:44, the Ground Proximity Warning System's (GPWS) ""Whoop whoop pull up"" alert sounded and the captain commanded ""TOGA"". The CVR recording ended at 18:05:58. Witnesses on or near State Highway 114 north of the airport saw flight 191 emerge from the rain about 1.25 miles from the end of runway 17L and then strike an automobile in the westbound lane of State Highway 114. Subsequent investigation showed that the airplane had touched down earlier and became airborne again before striking the automobile. After the plane struck the car and a light pole on the highway, other witnesses saw fire on the left side of the airplane in the vicinity of the wing root. The witnesses generally agreed that the airplane struck the ground in a left-wing-low attitude, and that the fuselage rotated counterclockwise after the left wing and cockpit area struck a water tank on the airport. A large explosion obscured the witnesses' view momentarily, and then the tail section emerged from the fireball, skidding backwards. The tail section finally came to rest on its left side with the empennage pointing south and was subsequently blown to an upright position by wind gusts. One hundred and thirtyfour persons on board the airplane and the driver of the automobile which was struck by the airplane were killed in the accident; 27 persons on board the airplane and 1 rescue worker at the accident site were injured, 2 passengers on the airplane were uninjured."
726,ACC700,Descended into trees when on a night time instrument approach to Gulkana runway 14.
728,ACC702,Shot down with a ground-to-air missile. The aircraft was flying at 3800 feet msl.
729,ACC703,"The aircraft departed Jenkinsburg on a skydiving flight. The engine lost power at approx 300 feet agl. and the Caravan then banked steeply left, spiralled in a steep nose down attitude and crashed. It appeared that the fuel in the tanks was contaminated with water and foreign material with the appearance of brown algae. A milky fluid (approx 65% jet fuel and 34% water) was found in the engine fuel control, as well as iron contaminants. Dark stringy material was found in the fuel filters. The aircraft had been refuelled from 55 gallon drums which contained contaminated fuel. The drums were stored upright and rain water could leak through the filler caps. N551CC had a history of fuel contamination which on occasions caused the fuel bypass indicator to display. Reportedly, the stall warning circuit breaker had been disengaged on other occasions, so as not to startle the jumpers; however, due to damage, its preimpact position could not be verified. The plane was estimated to be 370 lb (168 kg) over its maximum weight limit and 1 inch forward of the CG limit."
730,ACC704,"The Yak-40 should have climbed to 2400 m after takeoff, but was instructed to maintain 300 m because of an Antonov An-24 landing at a neighbouring airport. Bad weather was encountered when changing heading in an area of mountainous terrain. The aircraft collided with a mountain slope near Mikha-Tskhakaya.The aircraft operated on a flight from Tbilisi to Poti with en en route stop at Kutaisi."
731,ACC705,Impacted a mountainside at 3500 feet following a premature descent.
733,ACC707,A total loss of power was experienced on takeoff from runway 18 due to the fuel selectors being in the off position. the pilot attempted to restart the engine during which time the aircraft entered a stall and collided with the terrain. According to passengers the pilot did not use a checklist nor were the passengers briefed before the flight.
735,ACC709,"A Dassault Falcon 50 jet (N784B) and an Air Pegasus Piper PA-28-181 Archer (N1977H) collided about 1500 feet over the towns of Fairview and Cliffside Park, New Jersey, USA. The Falcon 50 was cleared for a standard instrument approach procedure in visual meteorological conditions and was in a left turn to position itself on the downwind leg to runway 19 at the Teterboro Airport, and the PA-28 was transiting the airport traffic area from west to east when they collided. The accident occurred 4 1/2 miles east-southeast at the edge of the airport traffic area in visual meteorological conditions. Both airplanes had been in radio contact with the Teterboro control tower. The flightcrew, the only occupants aboard the Falcon 50, and the pilot and two passengers onboard the PA-28 were killed. The Falcon 50 crashed into an apartment building killing one resident and seriously injuring two bystanders."
743,ACC717,"The Ilyushin Il-14M operated on a flight from the Molodezhnaya Ice Station to the Mirny Ice Station in Antarctica in support of the the 31st Soviet Antarctic Expedition. The estimated flight time was 7 hours and 45 minutes. The aircraft was equipped with skis and additional fuel tanks were located in the cabin.In the second half of the route, the crew got into severe icing conditions, which was not foreseen by the forecast, and was forced to reduce the flight altitude. Having descended to a level of 1500 m, the crew fell into the zone of a jet stream with hurricane force head winds (up to 140 km/h). This led to a decrease in ground speed and a shortage of fuel to reach the destination. At a distance of more than 200 km from Mirny station, the plane entered white out conditions with reduced visibility of almost zero.At 06:50 Moscow time, the crew reported that the remaining fuel was for 30 minutes of flight. At 07:05 it was decided to perform an emergency landing on a glacier. Due to the weather conditions it was impossible to determine the vertical distance to the glacier surface and its condition. Under these conditions the aircraft collided with the surface of the glacier. All occupants were killed."
745,ACC719,The no. 1 engine stopped and the propeller feathered 1 second following flap extension. The aircraft entered a left bank and turn and finally stalled and crashed 8 km short of the runway.The aircraft operated on a flight from Moscow Bykovo Airport to Bugulma with an en route stop at Cheboksary.
746,ACC720,"The aircraft pitched up, rolled left, crashed into trees and caught fire."
747,ACC721,"A wheel/ski-equipped DHC-3 Otter aircraft was on the return leg of a charter flight to Snegamook Lake to retrieve a hunting party of four, along with their hunting gear and bounty of several hundred ptarmigan. It departed Snegamook Lake at 09:15. After takeoff, the engine began to run rough but improved somewhat when the power was reduced for cruising. As the aircraft was approaching Nipishish Lake, the pilot reported to company dispatch that the engine was again running rough, but he was able to maintain altitude, and he would follow the Crooked River toward Goose Bay in case a precautionary landing became necessary. Three minutes later, C-FAGM called dispatch again, advising them that he was intending to land on a large area on the Crooked River. He also indicated that there was an odour of smoke in the aircraft. The aircraft was in a nose-down, left- bank attitude, with the flaps fully extended and the skis retracted when it struck the frozen surface of the river. The Otter bounced clear of the surface, turned left came to rest in an upright position."
748,ACC722,"The Antonov 12 descended too low on finals in below-minima weather conditions. It undershot the runway, struck three VASIs, overturned and caught fire."
750,ACC724,"Due to bad weather at the destination Alexandria, the Air Sinai F-27 returned to Cairo. The aircraft crashed short of the runway while approaching in a sandstorm. The aircraft collided with the side of a building and caught fire."
751,ACC725,"The takeoff was rejected at 246 km/h, 420 m before the end of the runway because of insufficient thrust and a spurious no. 2 engine vibration warning. Braking started 115 m before the end of the runway; the aircraft overran into a ravine. One passenger died of a heart attack."
752,ACC726,"The Martin, loaded with 600gal of pesticide settled back on the runway after a long takeoff run. The aircraft struck a 12 feet high dirt mound, flipped inverted and caught fire. It was determined that the pilot held a private certificate with ASMEL ratings and his medical certificate was denied. The co-pilot held a commercial certificate with ASEL rating, but none of the pilots appeared to have any operating experience on the Martin 4-0-4. The weight of the aircraft on takeoff was calculated to be 44,492 pounds, while the maximum gross total weight for a 4500 feet runway 'dry' takeoff was approx. 37,900 pounds."
756,ACC730,"The aircraft pitched up, rolled inverted and crashed left of Texarkana runway 13. It appeared that the aircraft had been loaded with the center-of-gravity (cg) well behind the aft limit. Also, the aircraft had been weighed on Sept. 8, 1984 and later on Feb. 1, 1986, weight & balance data had been recomputed after removal of a radar and an autopilot, but an error had been made during the weight and balance preparation. Subsequently, the aircraft was operated in a tail heavy condition. Tests showed the pilot and co-pilot had alcohol levels of 0.044% and 0.171%, respectively."
757,ACC731,"PanAm flight PA73 was a scheduled service between Bombay, India and New York-JFK Airport, USA, with intermediate stop at Karachi, Pakistan and Frankfurt, West Germany.During the stopover at Karachi, as passengers boarded the aircraft for the flight, a van that had been modified to look like an airport security vehicle, drove through a security checkpoint up to one of the boarding stairways of the aircraft. Four hijackers stormed up the stairways into the plane, fired shots from an automatic weapon and seized control of the aircraft. Flight attendants were able to alert the cockpit crew using intercom, allowing the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer to escape through a hatch in the cockpit. During the following 16 hours, Zayd Hassan Safarini, the Jordanian leader of the hijackers, demanded the return of the flight crew to fly the aircraft to Larnaca, Cyprus, where he wanted to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners being detained in Cyprus. During negotiations between Safarini and Pakistani authorities, Safarini threatened to kill all passengers. Four hours into the hijacking, one of the passengers was shot and pushed out the door onto the tarmac below. As nightfall arrived, the hijackers herded the passengers and crew members into the center section of the aircraft. The four hijackers opened fire on the passengers and crew, and threw grenades among them, killing almost 20. Most of the survivors escaped through two doors of the plane which were opened when the firing began.Pakistani special forces commando's then stormed the plane and arrested the hijackers."
758,ACC732,"An Aeroflot Tupolev 134 was on the ground at Ufa on a scheduled stop en route from Kiev to Nizhnevartovsk in western Siberia. Two armed men, reportedly fleeing from the police, opened fire as they tried to seize the aircraft and shot two passengers to death before both were fatally shot by security forces. Earlier the two men allegedly killed two policemen who tried to pursue them after they had commandeered a taxi and forced the driver to take them to the airport."
760,ACC734,"The Tupolev Tu-134 departed Mbala (MMQ), Zambia, for a flight back to Maputo (MPM). The flight carried Mozambique president Samora Machel who had attended a meeting of African leaders in Zambia. While approaching Maputo, an inadvertent selection of the MATSAPA VOR frequency caused the crew to execute a premature 37-degrees turn. Although the pilot queried the turn, no effort was made to verify it by using the available navigational aids. The aircraft descended below the 3000 feet limit in spite of not having visual contact with Maputo. The crew erroneously assumed a power failure at Maputo.A 32-second GPWS warning was ignored and the aircraft collided with the ground at 2187 feet, bounced and crashed into an uphill slope. The aircraft broke up, slid across the South African/Eswatini border and caught fire. Machel, along with 33 other occupants did not survive the accident."
762,ACC736,"The aircraft undershot runway 35 during a night time approach, impacted the edge of a ditch, broke up and eventually came to rest inverted. The co-pilot, who was under route check, let the aircraft descend below the MDA of 400 feet. The pilot was distracted from monitoring the height because he was attempting to talk to the co-pilot into correcting the approach."
763,ACC737,The pilots lost aileron control shortly after takeoff while in a left turn. The left turning tendencies of the aircraft could not be corrected and the aircraft crash landed in the Caribbean Sea. Post crash inspection of the aircraft revealed the left aileron control cable was trapped within a bundle of electrical wires and cables. This occurred when an electrical cable from a reverse current relay in the right wing to the main junction box in the left cabin area at the center wing was changed and secured. The aileron cable chafed through the protective cover of the large electrical cable. When contact was made with the metal electrical cable the aileron cable arched at several points and separated at two different points causing a loss of aileron control.
767,ACC741,"During arrival for a LOC runway 26 approach, the pilot was advised the abyss fan marker was notamed out-of-service. With abyss inoperative, the minimum descent altitude (MDA) was 2200 feet. After N65TD was cleared for the approach, radar service was terminated and the flight was cleared to advisory frequency. The crew contacted unicom and obtained airport and weather advisory. The Unicom operator advised winds light and variable, estimated 800 feet overcast, visibility 5 miles, slush and ice reported on runway 1/2 hr earlier. After the crew reported 'procedure turn inbound,' no further transmissions were received from the aircraft. Subsequently, it hit trees on rising terrain at an elevation of approx 2200 feet, approx 7 miles before reaching the final approach fix (FAF, DALTON NDB). Minimum altitude for the approach in that area was 3000 feet. No preimpact part problems were found during the investigation. Airport elevation was 1194 feet. Radio transcripts indicated the crew were getting a weak signal from the DALTON NDB. Although not a required navaid, CHESTER VORTAC was depicted on the approach chart as an additional source to id the FAF, but was notamed as out-of-svc. The pilot did not obtain notams before flight."
769,ACC743,"At 500 feet on approach to Nadi the right flap jammed at 35° while the left one continued to 60°. The aircraft rolled to 90° bank, struck the ground and cart wheeled short of runway 21.PROBABLE CAUSE: Unsecured non-standard flap attachment pin migrated upward and lodged in a lightening hole."
771,ACC745,"Crashed in Lake Ontario following engine failure. Both occupants were rescued by a helicopter after about one hour. The pilot survived, but died later due to the effects of hypothermia."
772,ACC746,"The Metro collided with a Mooney 20 (N6485U) at 7000 feet, while the Metro was on a runway 34 approach. Both airplanes fell to the ground with the wreckage scattered over 2sq miles in a residential area."
781,ACC755,"Douglas DC-3C C-FADD was returning to Pickle Lake from Big Trout Lake following delivery of a cargo of fuel. This was the third similar and last operation of the day. As the aircraft approached Pickle Lake, the pilot informed the company dispatch office that, prior to landing, he intended to carry out some local training for the benefit of the co-pilot who was scheduled to be upgraded to captain status the following month. The captain, a company training pilot, occupied the right seat. The aircraft entered a west to east holding pattern at the airport's NDB, descending in stages from 8,500 feet asl to 2,700 feet asl, the appropriate altitude for an instrument approach. The pilot transmitted that they would execute an NDB approach and subsequently reported during the procedure turn inbound to the airfield. About three minutes later, two other pilots flying in the vicinity observed the aircraft in a descent with the left wing folded upwards. The aircraft continued descending in an inverted attitude until it struck the ground."

790,ACC764,"While on an instrument flight plan in IMC, the flight was cleared for an instrument approach to the South Lake Tahoe Airport, the intended destination. The aircraft departed the initial approach fix on the published transition to the final approach course. Radar contact was lost at 11,400 feet. Afterward, the aircraft was observed descending out of clouds and manoeuvring erratically in VMC until it impacted terrain with no apparent attempt to recover. Medical records revealed pilot had a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and recent loss of 41 pounds on a rigid weight loss program. The autopsy revealed severe arteriosclorosis. Medical records indicated the pilot had been taking diazide intermittently for several years. Post-accident tox results were negative. The circumstances of the accident, in combination with the pilot's severe diet, medical history, and postmortem examination results support the conclusion that the pilot became incapacitated in flight."
794,ACC768,"Thai Airways Flight 365 was approaching Phuket VOR/DME on radial 119 after a flight from Hat Yai. At the same time Dragon Air Flight 203 (a Boeing 737 registered VR-HYL, carrying 62 occupants) also approached Phuket VOR/DME on radial 090. At 08:34 UTC Dragonair 203 reported at 2500 feet with Thai 365 in sight in front of them. The Thai Boeing was flying at 3000 feet at the time, and was 13 miles from Phuket VOR/DME. Dragonair 203, first priority in approach sequence, then turned right at 12 DME and was going to turn inbound for finals for runway 27. The Thai crew surmised that the other crew were making a false position report to gain landing priority and reported hurriedly that they were at 8 DME inbound and requested visual approach, though they hadn't reached 8 DME yet. This forced Phuket Approach to give Thai 365 landing priority at 08:35. The Dragonair crew (flying IFR) immediately warned that the Thai plane couldn't descend through their flight level. Concentrating on the conflicting traffic the speed decayed to 163 knots until the stick shaker activated. The Thai crew then applied power and raised the landing gear, but the aircraft entered a stall crashed into the sea, disintegrating on impact."
796,ACC770,"The Airbus touched down 700 m past the runway threshold. The right main gear hit runway lights and the aircraft collided with an antenna and fences. End of June 1987, the aircraft had totalled 9200 cycles and 20.600 flying hours."
799,ACC773,"The Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane took off from Memphis International Airport, TN (MEM), bound for Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Airport, KY (CVG). After takeoff the pilot was told by the Tower controller that the tail stand, used to prevent aircraft from tipping on tail when loaded, was still attached to the aircraft. The pilot requested a teardrop turn back to the departure runway. The aircraft was returning to runway 36R when it stalled. Recovery was attempted but the aircraft impacted the ground prior to completion of level off. The aircraft was 379 lb over maximum takeoff weight and cg was at least 3 inch forward of the limit. No record of a load manifest was found. The pilot in command had low PIC experience and received 2.7 documented flight hours with the operator's instructor pilot including his 135 competency check ride of 1.1 hours. The operator's initial training certification showed 5 hours of flight training. The aircraft, a Volpar Turboliner II cargo plane, was a stretched turbine conversion of a Beechcraft SNB-5 Navigator (Redesignated TC-45J in 1962) that was operated by the US Navy."

802,ACC776,"Crashed into hilltop while on a localizer-DME approach to runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport (LBA) in low cloud conditions.The laid down descent angle for a Localiser/DME approach to runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport is 3.5°. Whereas a standard 3 degree descent angle can readily be calculated and flown by a pilot using a formula of 300 feet per nautical mile, it is more difficult, particularly in single pilot operations, to calculate and achieve a 3.5° descent. An aircraft on a 3.5° approach angle, on a pressure setting of 998 mb, would pass approximately 100 feet above the accident site but, a 3° approach would result in ground contact in the area of the site."
805,ACC779,"While cruising in IMC the pilot encountered moderate to severe turbulence near an area where weather cells could have been observed on the aircraft's radar. The pilot reversed course, declared an emergency and lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft entered an uncontrolled descent, collided with terrain and was destroyed. It was reported that the newly hired pilot did not understand the Caravan's weather radar (nor was she required to by operator or FAA)."
806,ACC780,"The Islander broke up in flight and crashed. The pilot who was hired to ferry the plane told the ferry company he was an experienced Islander pilot, but no previous Islander flight time was found in the pilot's logbook."
807,ACC781,"The DHC-4A Caribou aircraft was en route from Calgary to Ross River where it was to be used to transport silver ore concentrate from the mines at Plata to Ross River. On board were two pilots, two company aircraft maintenance engineers to service the aircraft, and about 5,500 pounds of aircraft parts and equipment to support the operation of the aircraft in Ross River. One refuelling stop was made at Fort Nelson, after which the aircraft proceeded on an IFR flight plan to its destination. Ross River has no published instrument approach and is situated in a valley in mountainous terrain. It was necessary to overfly Ross River, proceed 30 miles to the northwest and complete an NDB approach at Faro where the minimum circling altitude is 2,709 feet agl. When below cloud at Faro, the aircraft must then proceed visually up the river valley to Ross River. The Caribou arrived over Faro at approximately 16:15, and an attempt was made to descend below the cloud base which was reported to be 400 to 600 feet agl. When visual reference with the ground was not made, the pilot climbed out to the southeast and informed Faro Community Airport Radio Station (CARS) that he was proceeding to his alternate, Watson Lake. In cruise flight the no. 2 engine began to lose oil, causing the oil pressure to drop to zero. The right engine was then shut down, and the propeller was feathered. A little later, the aircraft was heard flying out to the southeast for an approach to runway 26 at the Ross River Airport. On approach the landing gear had to be recycled because the nose gear did not lock down during the first attempt to lower the gear. The plane was no longer in a position to land, so the captain initiated a go-around. The aircraft passed by the town and then began to lose altitude, descending gradually into the trees. Portions of the right wing were torn off on contact with the trees, and the plane rolled to the right and nosed into the ground. The aircraft then cartwheeled over the embankment and down onto the river shore 20 feet below."
809,ACC783,"Flight 103 was fully loaded (all 19 seats occupied; 1437 pounds of cargo) when it took off from Kodiak runway 07. The aircraft lifted off the runway, fell back and accelerated for about another 15 knots before it became airborne. The aircraft was approaching Homer at 18:19 when it was cleared for the localizer/DME approach to runway 3. The crew reported a 2-mile final 5 minutes later. On short final the wings were seen to rock back and forth; the aircraft then dropped steeply to the ground in a rather flat attitude, struck the airport perimeter fence and slid to a stop on its belly."
810,ACC784,"Cessna Caravan ZK-SFB was one of two Caravans being used for cargo flights between Wellington (WLG) and Christchurch (CHC). The pilot on one of these flights had worked for 18 hours before the accident, had loaded and unloaded by hand some ten tons of freight and was soaked by rain while doing so because no foul weather gear was provided. Also he did not have a proper meal break before the flight and was eating sweets to sustain himself. After departure the aircraft climbed to an altitude of 11000 feet. Since the pilot had no oxygen indoctrination course, he would have been mildly hypoxic. Around midnight the aircraft encountered severe icing. The aircraft had no airframe de-icing equipment and the airspeed dropped until it stalled. The Caravan entered a spin and crashed into the sea off the Kaikoura Coast."
811,ACC785,"It appears that the wreckage of this crash has never been located. It is, however, believed that the plane went down in the vicinity of Mount Waddington. The death certificates for the four men aboard the plane list Mount Waddington as the place of death."
812,ACC786,"A British Aerospace BAe-146-200 passenger jet, registered N350PS, was destroyed when it impacted the ground near Paso Robles, CA. All five crew members and 38 passengers on board were killed. Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 1771 hade departed Los Angeles International Airport, CA (LAX) on a domestic flight to San Francisco International Airport, CA (SFO).A recently discharged USAir employee boarded the flight after bypassing security. He carried a borrowed 44 caliber pistol. His former supervisor was on board the flight. At 16:13, the pilot reported to Oakland ARTCC that he had an emergency and that gunshots had been fired in the airplane. Within 25 seconds, Oakland CTR controllers observed that PSA1771 had begun a rapid descent from which it did not recover. Witnesses on the ground said the airplane was intact and there was no evidence of fire before the airplane struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. The cvr tape revealed the sounds of a scuffle and several shots which were apparently fired in or near the cockpit. The pistol was found in the wreckage with 6 expended rounds. FAA rules permitted airline employees to bypass security checkpoints."
815,ACC789,"Crashed during an ILS approach in a slight noseup, slight right wing down attitude, with a high vertical rate of descent, and a high forward speed. The copilot was not rated in the aircraft and had logged a total of 7.9 of jet time in his logbook."
817,ACC791,Struck high ground on approach.
819,ACC793,"The no.1 and no. 3 engines rpm dropped on takeoff. The no. 2 engine rpm also dropped, but recovered. The no. 1 and no. 3 engines eventually shut down, causing the aircraft to lose speed. The plane stalled, collided with obstacles and broke up.PROBABLE CAUSE: Reduction in engine thrust during takeoff, probably because the crew closed the throttle."
820,ACC794,"The Swearingen Metro III, operating NFD flight 108, was destroyed when it impacted terrain near Kettwig, Germany, following a lightning strike. All 21 on board were killed.Scheduled departure time from Hannover Airport, Germany was 07:00 hours. However, due to snow fall during the night, the flight crew decided to de-ice the airplane prior to departure. The flight took off at 07:15 hours, bound for Düsseldorf. The climb to FL140 was uneventful. Just prior to descent the flight crew noticed a thunderstorm conditions in the area. Descent was commenced at 07:39. Eight minutes later the aircraft was cleared down to 3000 feet, and the controller reported that flight 108 was number three on approach.At 07:49 the controller warned no. 2 on approach that a previous aircraft had reported a lightning strike on final approach. He offered to vector the flight around the area. The offer was declined. At 07:50 the controller warned flight 108 as well: ""Flamingo 108 the same information for you, the preceding landing experienced a lightning strike on about 6 miles final"". The crew answered: ""we copied and are looking outside"".At 07:50:50 NFD flight 108 captured the localizer at an altitude of 2900 ft. The crew saw on the weather radar that the area with the thunderstorm activity was right in front of them. At 07:54:25 flight 108 flew into the thunderstorm.The first officer pointed out to the pilot in command, who was flying, that they were to the left of the approach course and asked him to turn to the right. The pilot in command replied that he did not necessarily want to fly ""in there"", but he changed course to return to the centreline. The flight crew then switched to the Düsseldorf Tower controller. There was no more contact with the flight. The aircraft entered s steep descent. Eyewitnesses on the ground saw the aircraft descending through the clouds and then pull up again, disappearing into the clouds. The aircraft became uncontrollable and broke up in flight."
822,ACC796,"During a non-standard approach in IMC a course reciprocal to clearance was flown. Visual contact was lost and the aircraft descended through decision height. The aircraft landed rough beside the runway, broke up and caught fire."
824,ACC798,An engine caught fire on the second takeoff attempt. The aircraft crashed at the runway end.
825,ACC799,A fire was discovered on board at FL90 and the aircraft returned. The descent rate increased and the aircraft struck the ground in a 45° angle. The fuel source was a leak under pressure from the right hand fuel booster pump or its adjacent plumbing.
827,ACC801,Struck a hill in bad weather during a flight from Muya to Bagdarin.The flight crew deviated from the established route and descended prematurely below the safe altitude.
829,ACC803,"On April 28, 1988, an Aloha Airline Boeing 737, N73711, was scheduled for a series of interisland flights in Hawaii. The crew flew three uneventful roundtrip flights, one each from Honolulu to Hilo (ITO), Kahului Airport, HI (OGG) on the island of Maui, and Kauai Island Airport (LIH). At 11:00, a scheduled first officer change took place for the remainder of the day. The crew flew from Honolulu to Maui and then from Maui to Hilo. At 13:25, flight 243 departed Hilo Airport en route to Honolulu. The first officer conducted the takeoff and en route climb to FL240 in VMC. As the airplane leveled at 24,000 feet, both pilots heard a loud ""clap"" or ""whooshing"" sound followed by a wind noise behind them. The first officer's head was jerked backward, and she stated that debris, including pieces of gray insulation, was floating in the cockpit. The captain observed that the cockpit entry door was missing and that ""there was blue sky where the first-class ceiling had been."" The captain immediately took over the controls of the airplane. He described the airplane attitude as rolling slightly left and right and that the flight controls felt ""loose."" Because of the decompression, both pilots and the air traffic controller in the observer seat donned their oxygen masks. The captain began an emergency descent. He stated that he extended the speed brakes and descended at an indicated airspeed (IAS) of 280 to 290 knots. Because of ambient noise, the pilots initially used hand signals to communicate. The first officer stated that she observed a rate of descent of 4,100 feet per minute at some point during the emergency descent. The captain also stated that he actuated the passenger oxygen switch. The passenger oxygen manual tee handle was not actuated. When the decompression occurred, all the passengers were seated and the seat belt sign was illuminated. The No. 1 flight attendant reportedly was standing at seat row 5. According to passenger observations, the flight attendant was immediately swept out of the cabin through a hole in the left side of the fuselage. The No. 2 flight attendant, standing by row 15/16, was thrown to the floor and sustained minor bruises. She was subsequently able to crawl up and down the aisle to render assistance and calm the passengers. The No. 3 flight attendant, standing at row 2, was struck in the head by debris and thrown to the floor. She suffered serious injuries. The first officer tuned the transponder to emergency code 7700 and attempted to notify Honolulu Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) that the flight was diverting to Maui. Because of the cockpit noise level, she could not hear any radio transmissions, and she was not sure if the Honolulu ARTCC heard the communication. Although Honolulu ARTCC did not receive the first officer's initial communication, the controller working flight 243 observed an emergency code 7700 transponder return about 23 nautical miles south-southeast of the Kahalui Airport, Maui. Starting at 13:48:15, the controller attempted to communicate with the flight several times without success.When the airplane descended through 14,000 feet, the first officer switched the radio to the Maui Tower frequency. At 13:48:35, she informed the tower of the rapid decompression, declared an emergency, and stated the need for emergency equipment. The local controller instructed flight 243 to change to the Maui Sector transponder code to identify the flight and indicate to surrounding air traffic control (ATC) facilities that the flight was being handled by the Maui ATC facility. The first officer changed the transponder as requested. At 13:50:58, the local controller requested the flight to switch frequencies to approach control because the flight was outside radar coverage for the local controller. Although the request was acknowledged, Flight 243 continued to transmit on the local controller frequency. At 13:53:44, the first officer informed the local controller, ""We're going to need assistance. We cannot communicate with the flight attendants. We'll need assistance for the passengers when we land."" An ambulance request was not initiated as a result of this radio call. The captain stated that he began slowing the airplane as the flight approached 10,000 feet msl. He retracted the speed brakes, removed his oxygen mask, and began a gradual turn toward Maui's runway 02. At 210 knots IAS, the flightcrew could communicate verbally. Initially flaps 1 were selected, then flaps 5. When attempting to extend beyond flaps 5, the airplane became less controllable, and the captain decided to return to flaps 5 for the landing. Because the captain found the airplane becoming less controllable below 170 knots IAS, he elected to use 170 knots IAS for the approach and landing. Using the public address (PA) system and on-board interphone, the first officer attempted to communicate with the flight attendants; however, there was no response. At the command of the captain, the first officer lowered the landing gear at the normal point in the approach pattern. The main gear indicated down and locked; however, the nose gear position indicator light did not illuminate. Manual nose gear extension was selected and still the green indicator light did not illuminate; however, the red landing gear unsafe indicator light was not illuminated. After another manual attempt, the handle was placed down to complete the manual gear extension procedure. The captain said no attempt was made to use the nose gear downlock viewer because the center jumpseat was occupied and the captain believed it was urgent to land the airplane immediately. At 13:55:05, the first officer advised the tower, ""We won't have a nose gear,"" and at 13:56:14, the crew advised the tower, ""We'll need all the equipment you've got."" While advancing the power levers to maneuver for the approach, the captain sensed a yawing motion and determined that the No.1 (left) engine had failed. At 170 to 200 knots IAS, he placed the No. 1 engine start switch to the ""flight"" position in an attempt to start the engine; there was no response. A normal descent profile was established 4 miles out on the final approach. The captain said that the airplane was ""shaking a little, rocking slightly and felt springy."" Flight 243 landed on runway 02 at Maui's Kahului Airport at 13:58:45. The captain said that he was able to make a normal touchdown and landing rollout. He used the No. 2 engine thrust reverser and brakes to stop the airplane. During the latter part of the rollout, the flaps were extended to 40° as required for an evacuation. An emergency evacuation was then accomplished on the runway."
830,ACC804,"Widerøe flight 710 took off from Trondheim (TRD), Norway, at 19:23 local time on a domestic light to Namsos (OSY), Brønnøysund (BNN), Sandnessjøen (SSJ) and Bodø Airport (BOO).The flight to Namsos was uneventful. The aircraft took off from Namsos at 20:07 and contacted Trondheim ACC six minutes later, stating that they were climbing from FL70 to FL90. At 20:20 the crew began their descent for Brønnøysund and switched frequencies to Brønnøysund AFIS.Weather reported at Brønnøysund was: wind 220°/05 kts, visibility 9 km, 3/8 stratus at 600 feet and 6/8 at 1000 feet, temperature +6 C, QNH 1022 MB.The crew executed a VOR/DME approach to Brønnøysund's runway 04, followed by a circle for landing on runway 22. The crew left the prescribed altitude 4 NM early. The aircraft descended until it flew into the Torghatten hillside at 560 feet.A retired police officer reported in July 2013 that a passenger had taken a mobile phone on board. The police officer disembarked the plane at Namsos, a stop-over and reported that the passenger with the mobile phone was seated in the cockpits jump-seat.After the accident, he reported this fact to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC). After reading the investigation report during the 25th anniversary of the accident, he noticed that there was no mention of the mobile phone.NMT 450 network-based mobiles at the time were fitted with a 15-watt transmitter and a powerful battery which could lead to disruption in electronic equipment.The Norwegian AIB conducted an investigation to determine if electronic interference from the mobile phone might have affected the flight instruments. The AIB concluded that there was no evidence to support the theory that there was any kind of interference."

A fire broke out, killing three occupants.The Mulhouse Flying Club had requested Air France to perform a fly by at their air show at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport on June 26, 1988.Air France prepared a low speed pass with the gear down at 100 feet and the another pass at high speed in clean configuration. While Air France had performed more than twenty low passes since 1987, the altitude of 100 feet was not allowed according to regulations. French air safety regulations imposed a minimum VFR overflight height of 170 feet.The fly by was to be performed using an Airbus A320, an aircraft model that was introduced by launching customer Air France in March 1988. F-GFKC was the third A320 in the fleet and had been delivered on June 23.The flight crew scheduled to perform the demonstration flight were two captains: the head of A320 training subdivision (Pilot Flying) and a captain participating in the placing into service of the A320(Pilot Monitoring).On board the flight were four cabin crew members and 130 passengers.The aircraft took off from nearby Basle-Mulhouse Airport at 14:41 and climbed to 1000 feet agl. The crew started the descent three minutes later and Habsheim was in sight at 450 feet agl. The Pilot Monitoring informed the Pilot Flying that the aircraft was reaching 100 feet at 14:45:14. The descent continued to 50 feet 8 seconds later and further to 30-35 feet. Go-around power was added at 14:45:35. The A320 continued and touched trees approximately 60 meters from the end of runway 34R at 14:45:40 with a 14 degree pitch attitude and engines at 83% N1. The plane sank slowly into the forest and a fire broke out."
843,ACC817,"Iran Air flight 451 arrived at Bandar Abbas (BND) from Tehran (THR) at 08:40. The Airbus A300 was to continue to Dubai (DXB) as flight 655. Prior to departure the crew received an enroute clearance to Dubai via the flight planned route A59 and A59W at FL140. The flight took off from runway 21 at 10:17 hours and climbed straight ahead.Two minutes later, the crew reported leaving 3500 feet for FL140 on Airway A59, estimating MOBET at 06:53 UTC (10:23 Iran time). At 10:24:00 the aircraft passed MOBET out of FL120. At 10:24:43 the Airbus was hit by surface-to-air missiles. The tail and one wing broke off as a result of the explosions. Control was lost and the aircraft crashed into the sea. The missiles were fired by the US Navy cruiser USS Vincennes. It was operating in the area together with the frigates USS Elmer Montgommery and USS John H. Sides. They were to protect other ships in the area.At about the time the Airbus took off, the radar aboard the USS Vincennes picked up a brief IFF mode 2 response, which led to the mistaken identification of the Airbus as a hostile F-14 aircraft. The USS Vincennes issued 7 challenges on the Military Air Distress (MAD) frequency 243 MHz, addressed to 'Iranian aircraft', 'Iranian fighter' or 'Iranian F-14'. These messages were followed by three challenges on the IAD (International Air Defence) radio frequency. Due to increasing tension in the area - on May 17, 1987 an Iraqi Mirage had attacked USS Stark - all aircraft in the area had to monitor 121.5 Mhz: the International Air Defence - IAD radio frequency. There was no response. Meanwhile radar operators were monitoring the Aegis screens. They reported that the incoming plane was descending with an increasing speed. In fact, the Airbus was climbing. Considering itself and USS Montgomery under aggression, USS Vincennes took the ultimate decision to launch missiles against the perceived hostile target at 10:24:22.It remains uncertain whether the IR655 flight crew (only able to monitor the IAD, not the MAD frequencies) would have been able to rapidly identify their flight as the subject of the challenges made by the USS Vincennes."
847,ACC821,"After landing at the aircraft's manufacturer facility at Tucson with an asymmetric fuel condition and an inoperative yaw damper, the crew elected to continue the flight to their destination without correcting the deficiencies. Enroute to Chino, California, the captain informed air traffic controllers that he had fuel coming from one tank and that he doubted that had fuel available to reach his destination. The controller cleared the aircraft to land at a nearby airport, Riverside-March Air Force Bay. As the aircraft turned onto the final approach for runway 32 it rolled inverted and impacted the ground inverted."
848,ACC822,"The CASA 212 was bought by Geoterrex in 1983 and registered in Canada in 1985. The plane had been extensively modified for aerial survey work. These modifications consisted of two probes mounted on the fuselage above the cockpit and extending 10 feet in front of the aircraft nose, a l6-foot tail boom, and two wing tip pylons. The probes, pylons, and tail boom served to support a wire loop antenna which ran around the aircraft. In July 1988 the plane was prepared for a ferry flight across the Atlantic to Nantes, France. For the purposes of this ferry trip, the survey loop antenna and the wing tip pylons had been removed and stowed in the main cabin area. For this configuration a special ferry permit was necessary, but the company did not apply for one. On July 31, 1988 the aircraft departed Ottawa and arrived at Goose Bay later that day. On 2 August 1988, the aircraft departed Goose Bay at 09:05 UTC and arrived at Narsarsuaq, Greenland at 12:50 UTC. The aircraft was refuelled and departed one hour later at 13:50 UTC for Reykjavik, Iceland, at a planned altitude of FL130. Although the pilots instrument rating had expired and the co-pilot did not possess one, the crew filed an IFR flight plan to Reykjavik. The weight of the aircraft was about 3,000 pounds above the maximum authorized takeoff weight on takeoff from Narsarsuaq. At Reykjavik, the crew flew an ILS approach to runway 20. During the approach, the flaps were set at approximately 25 degrees, 15 degrees above the approved maximum of 10 degrees. Approximately one-half mile from the runway threshold, the aircraft entered a steep turn to the right, and the nose of the aircraft dropped sharply. The aircraft continued to turn to the right through 270 degrees and descended rapidly until it struck the ground approximately 900 feet short of the runway threshold. The aircraft burst into flames shortly after impact."
849,ACC823,"A Pakistan Air Force Lockheed C-130B Hercules carrying Pakistani President General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq crashed shortly after takeoff from Bahawalpur Airport and caught fire. All 30 occupants were killed.Zia-ul-Haq had witnessed a tank inspection at Bahawalpur and was returning to Islamabad with his entourage, which consisted a.o. of several senior army generals and the American Ambassador to Pakistan.Many theories indicated that the accident was caused by sabotage. In 2008 newspaper The Times reported that, back in 1988, an analysis by a US lab found ""extensive contamination"" by brass and aluminium particles in the elevator booster package. This may have caused sluggish controls leading to overcontrol. This in turn may have led to the pilots losing control at low altitude soon after takeoff."
850,ACC824,"The flight crew failed to set the altimeters to aerodrome setting during the approach in poor weather. The aircraft descended into trees on the slope of a mountain (at 700 m altitude), broke up and caught fire. Crew duty time had exceeded 15 hours when the crash happened."
851,ACC825,"The An-2 operated on a survey flight out of Zhigansk, patrolling along the Lena River in order to identify sources of pollution along the route.The flight was carried out over the river Lena at a height of 100 m with an occasional descent to 50 m for the inspection of vessels. On the way back to Zhigansk the captain ordered the copilot to make a preliminary calculations of the next flight to Sangar. Thus the copilot did not actively monitor the position of the aircraft."
853,ACC827,"Flight DL1141 (Jackson - Dallas - Salt Lake City) left Gate 15 at 08:30 and was instructed to taxi to runway 18L. When first in line for takeoff (at 08:59) the flight was cleared for takeoff. The takeoff was uneventful until the airplane reached the rotation phase (at 154 knots, 6017 feet down the runway). As the main gear wheels left the ground, the airplane began to roll violently, causing the right wingtip to contact the runway (1033 feet after lift-off), followed by compressor surges. The plane continued and struck the ILS localizer antenna array 1000 feet past the end of runway 18L. After impacting the antenna installation, the airplane remained airborne for an additional 400 feet, then struck the ground, traversed a ground depression and slid sideways until it came to rest near the airport perimeter fence, 3200 feet from the runway end. Parts of the aircraft had separated in the slide and a fire had erupted in the right wing area, quickly engulfing the rear, right side of the airplane after it came to rest."
854,ACC828,Weather was poor as the airplane flew into the side of a mountain in the Sierra Madre.
855,ACC829,"The pilot encountered low ceilings, rain and fog while attempting to fly through a narrow mountain pass and successfully reversed course. He then flew into a small canyon off the main pass that terminated in a small glacier-covered bowl surrounded by steep rock walls. When it became apparent during a turn to reverse course that there was insufficient space to complete the maneuver before collision with a rock wall, the pilot retarded the throttles and crash landed on a glacier."
856,ACC830,"The pilot and his two passengers had just arrived at the Jackson Hole Airport, WY (JAC) approximately 30 minutes prior to the accident. The pilot dropped off his passengers and stepped into operations for a short break. He then returned to the aircraft by himself for a return flight to Redding Airport, CA (RDD). It was a very dark night with a 2000 ft overcast and no visible horizon. The pilot had departed Redding, CA at 13:57 hours and had been on continuous flight duty from that time until the time of the accident. A witness stated the pilot seemed to be tired and hungry. The aircraft was observed making a normal night takeoff. Witnesses stated that as the aircraft turned from crosswind to downwind it appeared that the pilot had trouble controlling the aircraft. After the aircraft made a few extreme up and down manoeuvres, it appeared to proceed to the east. The next time the aircraft was observed, it was again climbing and descending rapidly and subsequently impacted the ground in a vertical dive."
857,ACC831,"Ethiopian Airlines flight 604, a Boeing 737-200, was a scheduled service from Addis Ababa to Bahar Dar and Asmara. The first leg of the flight was uneventful. At 09:50, the engines were started normally and the airplane was taxied to its take-off position. The flight crew reported that In order to gain additional thrust they elected not to use engine bleed air during take-off. The airplane accelerated at a normal rate during the take-off roll and passed V1 (take-off-reject) speed. As the airplane passed V1 and very near VR (rotation speed) the flightcrew saw a flock of pigeons lifting up from the left side. At this time the captain took over control from the copilot and pulled up. Almost immediately after rotation, the airplanestruck the flock of pigeons at an airspeed of 146 knots and altitude of 5730 feet above mean sea level. Loud bangs were heard.The captain then called for gear up and the copilot complied. At approximately 100-200 ft. above the ground, both engines started backfiring. At this time, the flight crew reported that they experienced a considerable power loss and the airplane started mushing down at which time the captain ""fire walled"" the thrust levers. The engines reportedly responded and the airplane began to gain some altitude. The gain in attitude encouraged the captain to make a right turn away from Lake Tana and back to the take-off runway for landing.During the initial 32 seconds after the impact, the airplane had gained altitude from 5,730 feet to 6,020 feet and had accelerated from 146 knots to 154 knots.The crew report further indicated that both engines continued to surge and the exhaust gas temperature gauges (EGT) were reading at the top extreme and the engine pressure ratio (EPR) gauge readings were fluctuating at about 1.6. During this time the captain reported that the he reduced engine thrust to prolong the operational life of the engines. The frequency of the surges decreased with engines power reduction. The airplane entered an approximate 90 degree right turn. Altitude remained constant 6,020 feet while its airspeed increased from 154 knots to 162 knots. The airplane then began another right turn and entered the downwind leg of the return to runway 04. Altitude had increased to 6,410 feet and airspeed to 173 knots. On the downwind leg the aircraft further climbed to 7,100 feet. Then, within a timeframe of about five seconds, both engines lost power completely.The copilot pointed out a cleared area slightly ahead and to the right. The captain then turned towards the clearing and performed a gear-up landing. The aircraft broke up and a fire erupted.Out of the 104 occupants, 35 suffered fatal injuries."
859,ACC833,The flight approached Batagay (situated in mountainous area) at night. The crew decided to use a track that is allowed only for visual approaches. Intentional deviation from the approved procedure caused the GPWS to sound. The GPWS was switched off and the An-12 eventually collided with a mountain at 537 metres above the runway level.
860,ACC834,"An Ilyushin Il-14 was engaged in a sightseeing flight over the Linfen area. All passengers were employees of a local knitting factory. The aircraft was originally equipped with 14 seats but the airline allowed 44 passengers to board the plane. At 13:20 hours the aircraft took off from the local air base. Shortly after takeoff the aircraft lost height and the left wing hit a building, causing part of the wing to separate. The aircraft then hit eight poplars and impacted the roof of a hotel. Just four passengers survived the accident; 40 passengers, four crew and two pedestrians died.It was determined that the left engine had failed following a fatigue fracture in the engine's oil pump drive shaft."
861,ACC835,"A Douglas DC-3C was destroyed when it crashed in Pikangikum Lake, ON, Canada. Both the pilot and the co-pilot were fatally injured in the accident.The airplane departed Red Lake Airport, ON (YRL) as Air Ontario flight 937 on a flight to Pikangikum Airport, ON (YPM). The main cargo load being carried consisted of a rubberized bladder tank containing 2,068 litres of fuel oil.Weather at the Pikangikum Airport was poor with drizzle, low clouds, and fog, with a visibility of one and one-half to two miles. The airplane was heard overflying the airport and turning over the Pikangikum Lake in preparation for a final approach and landing on runway 27. While over the water the airplane stalled and struck the ice-covered lake 180 feet south of a tree-covered island. It descended through the ice and struck the lake bottom at a depth of 8 to 12 feet. The ice thickness at the area of impact varied from one inch to three inches."
864,ACC838,"The air ambulance Beechcraft A100 King Air, Voyageur 796, with two flight crew members and two paramedics on board, departed Timmins for Chapleau, Ontario on an instrument flight rules (IFR) flight. There, a seriously injured person was to be boarded andflown to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. The aircraft proceeded from Timmins en route at 12,000 feet, and, on arrival at Chapleau, theaircraft overflew the airport at low altitude and crashed 1.5 miles southwest of the airport. The four occupants were fatally injured, and the aircraft was destroyed by the impact and post-impact fire."
865,ACC839,"The Twin Otter left the oil fields at Hamada around 07:05 on a regular daily oilfield crew-change flight to Tripoli (TIP). Twelve employees of Arabian Gulf Oil Co/AGOCO and Halliburton Company were on board. Due to military activities in the area of the flight route, the crew were instructed to return to Hamada. In the meantime a thick morning mist had suddenly precipitated at Hamada. The crew circled the area for a while. While attempting to land, the plane contacted an asphalted pipeline bridge which was crossing just west of the main [concrete] runway, hit a wooden electrical pylon, came to rest and burnt.He pilot had probably mistaken the bridge for the runway. Also, a DF beacon was located about half a mile offset westwards from the runway."
866,ACC840,"The Boeing 707 departed Dar Es Salaam (DAR) on a cargo flight to Brussels (BRU), Belgium via Cairo (CAI), Egypt. Weather at Cairo was poor with a visibility of 400 m. After two missed approaches, at 20:53 and 21:07, the crew decided to divert to Luxor. The aircraft did not reach Luxor and crashed into a residential area at Karm `Umran, 45 km North of Luxor. The aircraft presumably ran out of fuel."
868,ACC842,"After departing the floatplane base on a company VFR flight plan, the Otter proceeded northwest along a salt water strait at a low altitude above water. Two miles Northwest of the airport the aircraft entered a snow squall and the pilot attempted a steep turn to reverse course. During the turn the aircraft impacted and sank in 167 feet deep water."
871,ACC845,"United Airlines Flight 811, a Boeing 747-122, N4713U, took off from Honolulu (HNL), Hawaii at 01:33 local time, bound for Sydney, Australia, with an intermediate stop at Auckland, New Zealand. The initial climb passed through an area of thunderstorms, so the captain elected to keep the seat belt sign on. As the aircraft was climbing, between 22,000 and 23,000 feet, explosive decompression was experienced. An emergency was declared at approximately 02:20 HST. The captain initiated a 180-degree left turn to avoid a thunderstorm and proceeded toward HNL. The forward lower lobe cargo door had opened in flight, taking with it a large portion of the forward right side of the cabin fuselage. The starboard side engines (no.3 and 4) were damaged and had to be shut down. Parts of the leading and trailing edge flaps where also damaged resulting in the crew electing to use only 10-degrees trailing edge flaps for landing (a non-normal configuration). This resulted in the aircraft having to land at a higher speed than it would under normal conditions. The aircraft was cleared to land at HNL runway 8L. At 02:34 HST, Honolulu tower was notified by the flight crew that the airplane was stopped and an emergency evacuation had commenced on the runway. During the decompression, nine passengers had been ejected from the airplane and lost at sea."
872,ACC846,"Air Ontario Flight 1363, a Fokker F-28 jet, crashed during takeoff from Dryden Municipal Airport, Ontario, Canada. Of the 69 persons on board, 24 suffered fatal injuries.The aircraft in question, registration C-FONF, had suffered from a malfunctioning auxiliary power unit (APU) for the five days preceding the accident. Throughout the week preceding March 10, Air Ontario maintenance attempted, with limited success, to cure the APU problems. On March 9 it was decided to defer the repair of the APU until the aircraft returned to Toronto on the night of March 10. This meant that the aircraft was dispatched with the APU inoperable. On the morning of March 10, C-FONF departed Winnipeg on a round trip flight to Dryden, Thunder Bay and back as flight 1362/3. Since no external power unit was available at Dryden, the engines couldn't be restarted in case of engine shutdown on the ground.  The flight to Thunder Bay was unentful apart from a slight delay due to poor weather at Thunder Bay. As the aircraft was prepared for the return flight, it appeared that the aircraft was overweight as a result of ten additional passengers having transferred to the flight due to an earlier cancellation. The Air Ontario duty manager decided to off-load fuel and to arrange refuelling at Dryden. This caused an additional delay of 35 minutes.The Fokker F-28 departed Thunder Bay at 11:55 hours EST, about one hour behind schedule. The aircraft landed at Dryden at 11:39 hours CST. It began to snow lightly when the aircraft landed.Between 11:40 and 12:01, Air Ontario 1363 was refuelled with the right engine operating and with the passengers remaining on board the aircraft. This so called 'hot refuelling' procedure was followed because the APU was unserviceable. Eight passengers deplaned in Dryden and seven passengers boarded the aircraft.Meanwhile, snow was accumulating on the wings, forming a layer of 1/8-1/4 inch. No de-icing was done because de-icing with either engine running was prohibited by both Fokker and Air Ontario. The aircraft then taxied to runway 29 for departure, but was instructed to hold as there was a Cessna 150 on approach. The snow was continuing to fall heavily, becoming increasingly thick on the wings. At 12:09 the aircraft started its takeoff roll on the slush-covered runway 29. There was an accumulation of at least one-half inch of wet, layered snow on the wings of the F-28 as it began its takeoff roll.After a longer than normal takeoff roll, the aircraft was rotated near taxiway Alpha, at approximately the 3500 foot mark. The aircraft lifted off slightly, began to shudder, and then settled back down onto the runway. The takeoff roll then continued and the aircraft was rotated a second time, finally lifting off at approximately the 5700 mark of the 6000 foot runway. It flew over the end of the runway approximately 15 feet above the ground. It thereafter failed to gain altitude and mushed through the air in a nose-high attitude, before commencing to strike trees.The aircraft crashed and came to rest in a wooded area, 3156 feet past the runway end and caught fire."
874,ACC848,Crashed shortly after the pilot radioed that he was attempting an emergency landing in the jungle because of engine problems.
875,ACC849,"Before the flight, the pilots of two Beechcraft 200 aircraft evaluated weather reports at a fixed base operation and made a computer weather inquiry. They departed Santa Monica Airport, CA (SMO), on a positioning flight to Farmington Municipal Airport, NM (FMN), without filing a flight plan. While en route, the lead aircraft was about 1 to 3 minutes ahead of the second aircraft. The second pilot reported they were at about 4500 ft msl as they neared mountains and the clouds were about 1000 ft above. As they continued eastward in a valley, the second pilot heard the lead pilot report he was 'going up.' This was the last known transmission from the lead aircraft. The second pilot continued his flight in VMC. Two days later, the lead aircraft was found, where it had crashed about 100 ft below the top of a 7400 ft mountain ridge. Impact occurred on a heading of about 030 deg. The mountain ridge was oriented on headings of 060 and 240 degrees."
878,ACC852,The aircraft crashed during a training flight.

885,ACC859,"A Douglas C-118A (DC-6A) fire fighting plane was destroyed in an accident near Sainte-Anne-des-Monts, QC, Canada. All four crew members were killed.The Conifair plane took off from Bonaventure Airport, QC (YVB) at 19:15 for a spray operation 30 miles southeast of Sainte-Anne-des-Monts. This was to be the last spraying flight of the season out of the Bonaventure base. A crew of four was on board, including two flight engineers who were on a familiarization training flight. The aircraft was carrying 2,952 U.S. gallons of Dipel 132, a non-toxic microbial insecticide.The aircraft arrived over the spray area at 19:35. An inertial navigation system (INS) to follow pre-established spraying tracks. The first track was sprayed uneventfully. At the end of the first track, the aircraft made a 180-degree turn to spray the second track, which was parallel to and about 800 feet northeast of the first track. This meant that the aircraft had to fly from a valley at an elevation of 1,000 feet above sea level (asl) up a mountain consisting of two levels. The first level is about 1,800 feet asl and about 3,280 feet along the flight path. After the first level, the terrain rose within approximately 1,000 feet along the flight path, to the summit of the mountain at an elevation of 2,175 feet asl.The two occupants of a Cessna 310 spotter aircraft observed a decrease of the DC-6A ground speed during the climb over the first level of the mountain. They then noticed that the aircraft yawed and started a steep, left turn. The spotter crew stated that, shortly after the start of the left turn, the DC-6A left wing began to strike trees. The aircraft nosed down, crashed on the side of the mountain, and exploded at an elevation of 2,050 feet asl."
886,ACC860,The aircraft crashed 10 min after takeoff.
887,ACC861,The Antonov was on an ice observation flight over the East Siberian Sea to guide ships when the left wing struck coastal cliffs during a procedural turn that was performed too close to the shore.
889,ACC863,"Flight Air Freight 1 was a scheduled night freight flight between Palmerston North, Auckland and Christchurch. The crew consisted of a training captain and two new co-pilots who were to fly alternate legs as co-pilot and observer. The co-pilots ADI of the Convair CV-580 in question had a known intermittent defect, but had been retained in service. The aircrafts MEL however did not permit this flight to be undertaken with an unserviceable ADI. The aircraft nevertheless departed Palmerston North and arrived at Auckland at about 20:30. It was unloaded and reloaded with 11 pallets of cargo. On the next leg, to Christchurch, the handling pilot was to be the other co-pilot. Although she had completed her type rating on the Convair 580 this was her first line flight as a crew member. The flight was cleared to taxi to runway 23 for departure. Takeoff was commenced at 21:59. The aircraft climbed to a height of approx. 400 feet when it pitched down. It entered a gradual descent until it contacted the ground 387 m beyond the end of runway 23 and 91 m left of the extended centreline. The aircraft then crashed and broke up in the tidal waters of Manukau Harbour."
890,ACC864,"Flying VFR in IFR conditions, the aircraft approached Samos. Having deviated 4nm from the H-59 airway, the aircraft was manoeuvred on a collision course with some mountains while turning for a runway 09 approach. The plane, named ""Isle of Milos"", struck cloud-shrouded Mount Kerkis (1430 m high)."
891,ACC865,"Islander ZK-EVK departed from Wanaka on a VFR scenic flight to Milford Sound but failed to arrive. Wreckage from the aircraft was subsequently located on steep snow covered mountainous terrain at elevations up to 5400 feet. Following initial impact, major portions of the aircraft, including the fuselage, had fallen over precipitous bluffs."

894,ACC868,"PIA Flight PK-404, a Fokker F-27 Friendship, departed Gilgit (GIL) at 07:36 on a domestic passenger service to Islamabad (ISB), Pakistan. There were 49 passengers and five crew members on board.At 07:40 the crew radioed that they expected over point Bravo at 07:59 and at Islamabad at 08:32. This was the last transmission received from the crew.The flight was declared missing. It is presumed that the aircraft crashed, killing all aboard."
897,ACC871,"During arrival, the flight was issued the current altimeter setting. The pilot requested vectors for an approach to runway 18, but the ARTCC controller could not accommodate the request. The pilot was cleared for a VOR/DME-A approach. MDA for the approach was 1080 feet msl (600 feet agl). FBO personnel observed the aircraft fly over the airport and advised that it was too low. One of the pilots replied that they would be 'staying under the clouds.' The pilots had planned to land on runway 36, but reported they lost sight of the runway and would change to runway 18. Subsequently, the aircraft collided with a tree about 1 mile NNE of the airport, while on a westerly heading (approx position of base leg for a VFR pattern). The aircraft came to rest about 700 feet west of the tree and was destroyed by impact and fire. The weather was in part: scattered clouds at 200 feet, overcast at 900 feet, visibility 3 miles with rain and fog, wind from 360 deg at 7 kts. The airport manager estimated there was a 200 feet ceiling at the airport."
899,ACC873,"A Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III passenger plane, operating as Skylink Flight 070 was destroyed in accident at Terrace Airport, BC (YXT), Canada. All five passengers and two crew members were killed.Flight 070 took off from Vancouver, BC (YVR) at 06:51 on a scheduled domestic flight to Terrace, BC. At 08:20 Flight 070 was cleared for an approach at Terrace. At 08:27, at an altitude of 1,200 feet asl and just prior to reaching the published missed approach point (MAP), the captain stated ""OK, I got the button here."" Fourteen seconds after this, the captain saw the button of runway 27. At approximately this same time, the aircraft was observed on what corresponded to a downwind leg for runway 15 at about 500 feet above ground level (agl), flying straight and level over the threshold of runway 27, with the landing gear down. The aircraft crossed the localizer transmitter at an altitude of 1,100 feet asl and at an airspeed of 140 knots. Approximately 30 seconds after crossing the localizer transmitter, the aircraft commenced a descent out of 1,100 feet, and the flaps were lowered to the full position. The aircraft then levelled at an altitude of approximately 900 feet. At or about this same time, the aircraft was observed on base leg for runway 15 at a low altitude, close to the east/west ridge located about 1.5 miles north of the airport. Twenty-six seconds after full flap was selected, a missed approach was initiated, and the landing gear and flaps were selected up. Within five seconds of the initiation of the missed approach, the aircraft began to accelerate and a rate of climb of approximately 1,200 feet per minute was established. This rate of climb quickly diminished to zero, followed by the start of a descent which quickly increased to 3,000 feet per minute. As the aircraft descended, the co-pilot called ""descending"" twice. A few seconds later, the aircraft struck trees on the west side of runway 15 just inside the airport perimeter. A second and final impact with the ground occurred just outside the airport perimeter approximately 800 feet from the initial tree strike. A fire erupted following the ground impact."

902,ACC876,"The Caravan I took off at night from a private/unlighted strip with a professional (ATP) pilot and the non-instrument rated owner/pilot at the controls. After takeoff, the aircraft entered a slight left turn. Subsequently, it hit the top of a tall pine tree, about 80 feet (25 m) above ground level and 202 feet (62 m) left of the runway centreline. The aircraft then crashed into other trees after travelling about an additional 450 feet (138 m). It was not determined which pilot was actually flying the plane. Toxicology checks showed the owner had a blood/alcohol level of 0.041% (41 mg/dl) and a urine/alcohol level of 0.012% (12 mg/dl). Toxicology checks of the professional pilot's blood and urine were negative for alcohol."
904,ACC878,The Islander had departed Adana (ADA) for a photo mapping flight of a forested area near the border with Syria. Some 20 km from the Syrian border the airplane was shot down by two Syrian Air Force MiG-21bis fighter jets.
905,ACC879,"The Ilyushin Il-76 cargo plane departed Ulyanovsk on a training/cargo flight to Leninakan. The aircraft carried a cargo of 37200 kg. Approaching Leninakan the flight was cleared to descend to 3300 metres. During the descent the approach controller reported the airport pressure being 637 mm Hg. After issuing a further clearance down to 1100 metres, the controller corrected the airport pressure to 637 mm Hg. Erroneously the crew programmed their barometric altimeters using 736 instead of 636 mm Hg, causing a difference in altitude indication of about 1100 metres. Descent was continued at a vertical speed of 10 m/sec. At a height of 270 metres the GPWS alarm began to sound and continued to 19 seconds. Then the flight engineer suddenly informed the captain of the mistake, but no corrective action was taken. Ten seconds later the aircraft struck terrain and crashed."
907,ACC881,Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712 departed Kahului at 18:25 for a 25-minute VFR flight to Kaunakakai. The aircraft climbed to 1000 feet and descended to 500 feet at 18:30. The plane struck a 27deg rocky slope on the north-eastern slopes of the coastal mountains on the island of Molokai at around 600 feet.
909,ACC883,"A Cessna 551 Citation II/SP corporate jet, registered LN-AAE, was destroyed in a CFIT accident near Bardufoss Airport (BDU), Norway. The passenger and three crew members were killed. The airplane took off from Tromsø/Langnes Airport (TOS) at 22:48 with call sign Scanvip (AXP) 05 for an air ambulance service to Bardufoss Airport (BDU). At 22:52 the crew established radio contact with the Bardufoss control tower, reporting at FL80. The controller reported that they could expect a runway 29 ILS clearance.Two minutes later the crew asked for clearance to go down to 6000 feet. The controller approved the descent and cleared the flight for the approach, instructing the crew to report when established on the ILS.At about 22:57:50 at a position about 8 NM North of the Målselv (MLV) NDB, the airspeed increased from 265 kts to 285 kts over a distance of about 5 NM. This speed was maintained up to the NDB. At 22:59:30 LN-AAE passed the MLV NDB. Instead of performing the left hand procedure turn from 174 degrees to 122 degrees, the crew continued on the present heading for about 30 seconds at an airspeed about 100 knots above the recommended approach speed. The aircraft was about 2 NM (4 km) south in relation to the established procedure pattern. The airplane should still have been at 6000 feet until established on the ILS but it had descended 1250 feet below the minimum altitude until it collided with a relatively flat mountain ridge just south of the summit of Langfjelltind (4935 FT)."
910,ACC884,"The Antonov An-24B of Aeroflot's Uralsk division was operating a charter service to fly oil workers from Perm to Sovetsky. The departure was delayed because of poor weather at Sovetsky.The weather gradually improved and the aircraft then departed Perm at 13:55 Moscow time. After an uneventful flight, the aircraft positioned for an approach to runway 30. The approach was conducted in darkness and poor visibility conditions. The weather reported to the crew on final approach (80 m overcast, 2000 m visibility) was below minima for the An-24.Nevertheless, the flight crew continued the approach. By then the aircraft had already descended below the glideslope.The radio altimeter warned the crew when the descent was continued below a height of 62 m, but the aircraft kept descending.At a height of 35 meters the flight crew attempted to pull up, but the aircraft collided with trees at a distance of 180 m to the right of the extended runway centreline. The no.2 engine autofeathered as a result, but the no.1 engine was delivering go around power. This caused the aircraft to enter a 27° right hand bank. This was briefly countered by the crew before the aircraft again rolled hard right and subsequently impacted terrain 700 m from the threshold, 250 m right of the extended centreline."
912,ACC886,"After takeoff from Dzhambul Airport (DMB), the aircraft entered an area of with icing conditions and fog. These conditions were not forecast.As a result of icing, engine power decreased. The crew decided to return to the departure airport but the airspeed decreased until the airplane stalled and crashed."
913,ACC887,"The aircraft, flown by Tepper Aviations chief, reportedly was carrying out a flight on behalf of the CIA to provide the Angolan UNITA guerrilla forces with weapons. It crashed while coming in to land at Jamba. These flights were flown at night at a very low altitude to avoid MPLA radar detection. The runway at Jamba was dirt, the approach was over trees, and the portable runway lighting was probably marginally adequate."
914,ACC888,Crashed at sea.
917,ACC891,"The ""smoke in the rear cargo hold"" warning activated during cruise at 10,600 m. The presence of smoke was confirmed but the source of fire could not be identified. Then the APU fire warning activated. The crew initiated an emergency descent to land at an intermediate airport. During descent the fire warning in both powerplants activated, the DC electrical system went dead, the attitude indicators, the compass system and the flap extension system shut off and the electromechanical altimeters stopped working. The crew force landed in a snow-covered field 3 km from Pervouralsk. The aircraft collided with irrigation equipment and broke up."
919,ACC893,"Flight 824 departed Denver at 06:42 for an IFR flight at FL180 to Montrose. The aircraft climbed to FL145 and maintained that altitude until crashing 50 feet (15 m) below the summit of the 14,221-ft (4350 m) Mount Massive. Toxicological tests revealed marijuana metabolite level of 37 ng/ml in urine and 1 ng/ml in blood. The pilot was once convicted in 1974 for possession of controlled substance, but had no other alcohol/drug convictions."
920,ACC894,"The Caravan was overloaded by 360 lb (163 kg) structurally and 1100 lb (500 kg) for flight in icing conditions. With moderate snow falling, the takeoff run on runway 15 was described as long. The wings were rocking and the plane struck trees and crashed. A FedEx Caravan crashed under the same circumstances just about 40 km (25 miles) away at 20:33."
930,ACC904,"Force landed following an engine failure, narrowly missing a row of houses. The DC-3 struck an electricity post and crashed in a rice field. It is reported that the crew tried to takeoff for the second time; the first attempt ended with a forced landing on a taxiway. MATS was not authorized to carry passengers. About one year previous (May 6, 1989) another MATS DC-3 (RP-C82) crashed near Manila, also carrying passengers without being authorized to do so. There were no fatal injuries in that accident though."
933,ACC907,"Frontier Air Flight 1602 took off from Timmins at 20:43 on a scheduled domestic flight to Moosonee. The flight proceeded to Moosonee at 7,000 feet and was cleared for an approach at 21:21. The crew elected to fly the VOR runway 24 approach. At 21:29, the crew reported on the 061-degree radial of the VOR at five nm outbound. Shortly after intercepting the 061-degree radial inbound, the crew initiated a descent to the 440-foot MDA. While in the descent, the aircraft broke through the lowest cloud layer at 900 feet asl, approximately 9.2 nm from the VOR At this point, both pilots had the runway lights in sight, and the captain decided to change to a visual approach and proceed inbound at 700 feet asl. Shortly after advising the co-pilot of his intentions, the captain initiated the before-landing cockpit check and lowered the landing gear. Immediately thereafter, the aircraft struck trees and crashed."
934,ACC908,"Cessna 500 VH-ANQ was operating the Proserpine to Mareeba leg of a charter flight The aircraft departed Proserpine at 16:35 hours. The charter flight had been organised to transport members of five local government authorities from the Cairns/Atherton Tablelands area to a Local Government Association Conference at Airlie Beach, Queensland.The flight plan indicated that the flight would follow Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) with a planned cruising altitude of FL330. The aircraft was planned to track via overhead Townsville then direct to Mareeba with a flight time interval of 68 minutes. The flight apparently continued normally and at 17:26 the aircraft was cleared to descend to FL170 and instructed to call Cairns Approach.On first contact with Cairns Approach, the pilot advised that the aircraft was tracking for Mareeba via the 163 radial at 41 miles (76 kilometres) DME from Biboohra. (There are no radio navigational aids at Mareeba, the nearest aids for tracking and instrument approach purposes are at Biboohra, about 16 kilometres north of Mareeba). The aircraft was advised to maintain FL170 but a short time later was cleared to descend to FL120. The pilot stated that he would not be closing down the engines at Mareeba and that his estimated departure time was 17:50.At 17:35 hours VH-ANQ was cleared to descend to 10,000 feet and one minute later the pilot advised that the aircraft was ""approaching over Mareeba and visual"". Cairns Approach advised VH-ANQ that there would be a short delay at 10,000 feet and following a request from the pilot gave approval for the aircraft to circle over Mareeba.At 17:40 hours, Cairns Approach instructed the aircraft to descend to 7,000 feet. This transmission, and other subsequent transmissions to the aircraft, went unanswered.The wreckage of VH-ANQ was ultimately located on the eastern slopes of Mt Emerald, 15 kilometres south of Mareeba Airport, by searching helicopters at 0240 hours on 12 May 1990. The aircraft initially impacted the mountainside with the left wingtip, while travelling on a track of about 340 degrees Magnetic. At the time it was in a wings level attitude at an angle of descent of eight degrees. It then struck the ground just below the apex of a ridge and the wreckage spread in a fan shape, at an angle of 30 degrees, along a centreline track of 350 degrees Magnetic."
935,ACC909,"A Beechcraft 1900C, operating for Aerolift Philippines as flight 75 to Surigao, took off from runway 13 at Manila's international airport. During takeoff the no. 2 engine failed.

It operated on a flight from Kingston, Jamaica, to Houston, Texas, USA with an en route stop at Cozumel.The flight contacted Cozumel Tower at 18:33 hours, reporting at 14 DME. The controller then cleared the flight for a VOR/DME approach to runway 29 and to report passing the VOR or field at sight. One minute later, the crew reported having the field in sight and so requested to make a visual approach, directly to runway 29. The controller authorized this and instructed to report at 5 DME.The aircraft was subsequently cleared to land, with wind reported to be calm.The final approach was low and the aircraft hit the ground 500 m short of the threshold."
952,ACC926,"The pilot, a heart transplant surgeon, planned a return flight to Las Cruces to retrieve a donor heart. After takeoff into a dark, clear, moonless night towards open, flat terrain with few ground lights, the aircraft impacted the ground in a left wing/nose slightly low attitude at high speed.

The Boeing 737-300, N388US, aircraft entered LAX airspace around 17:57 and was cleared for a CIVET Two Profile Descent and ILS runway 24R approach. At 17:59 this was changed to a runway 24L approach clearance.At about the same time a SkyWest Metro III aircraft (Flight 5569 to Palmdale) taxied out from Terminal 6, Gate 32 to runway 24L. At 18:03 the crew were advised to ""taxi up to and hold short of 24L"" because of other traffic. At 18:04:49 the flight was cleared to taxi into position and hold. Immediately thereafter the controller became preoccupied with instructing WingsWest Flight 5006 who had unintentionally departed the tower frequency. The WingsWest 5072 reporting ready for takeoff caused some confusion because the controller didn't have a flight progress strip in front of her. The strip appeared to have been misfiled at the clearance delivery position. Meanwhile, Flight 5569 was still on the runway at the intersection with taxiway 45, awaiting takeoff clearance.At 18:07 Flight 1493 touched down. Simultaneous to the nosegear touchdown, the Boeing 737 collided with the SkyWest Metro. Both aircraft caught fire and slid to the left into an unoccupied fire station."
